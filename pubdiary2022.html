Tufail whats-app: +91-8867205331

He left us a bit early so I'm going to send an email to better understand how an object interacts with database
to save stored values.

Okay so I can at least put my issue into words now.
I don't understand how to store the userid from the database back into the java as
we cant do the normal login.setUserId because it is of default value... what am I 
missing here? Will dive in tomorrow morning.

</p>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>I'm not sure if it's better in this order, but working so far.
	Have a late start today. Olava didn't sleep at all and kept us up. I'll
	get going once class starts. No use getting 4 minutes of work in and
	stopping down. Class is starting now.</P>
<p>**** QC Inline and block statements Id or class and other
	selectors javascript client side validation. make webpages more
	interactive. to generate html dynamically. We are setting up AWS
	accounts now. This is what I've been waiting for. I was doing this on
	my own when in Philly back in December. Now revisiting.</p>

	<p>I'm pulling this into eclipse and seeing if it makes more sense rather than
	having two IDEs.... but as I'm writing this I realized it wont work because it pushes
	my Eclipse over the zoom video that I use to watch Tufail's screen as he teaches us.
	So that was a quick no.

	Will stick with ATOM for note taking unless I add another monitor in here and can have
	Tufail's screen on one. My code on another and then a 3rd screen for browser/notes/chat.
	But now Im thinking I do the TV for just the Zoom video and my computer for the coding...
	Trying to think why this wouldnt work. Going to give it a try for a bit.
	I do really like the integration that atom has with GIT and github.
	Wonder if eclipse has it as well. In order to see updates on atom code I just have to hit save on eclipse.
	But to see it in eclipse I have to close and reopen.
	</p>
	<p>
	AWS is all setup for next week.
	Back into JavaScript learning.
	
	JavaScript 
		functions
			built in functions
	
	Javascript is sweet. powerful in a tiny punch. Can see how useful it will be with
	databases for user interfaces.
	
	We just blazed through alert(), parseInt(), confirm(), functions, and onclick.
	Tufail says to always open the console in browser when typing in javascript.
	That's how to check errors as they happen.
	</p>
	<p>
	String methods:
		toLowerCase()
		toUpperCase()
		slice()
		charAt()
	I tested a few out with his hands on example.
	Math methods:
		sin(x)
		cos(x)
		tan(x)
		floor(x)
	Math.pow()
	Math.random()
	</p>
	<p>
	Can use constructors in javascript
	
	We went on a 20 minute break. back now and working with javascript.
	Feels nice being back.
	</p>
	Variable scope-
		local vs global
		
		if you don't put var before declaring variable it can be called in other function
		as long as its function was called in that function.
		
		hoisted is when declared variable is moved to top of code.
	**** QC What is variable scope in javascript?
		lexical scope
		hoisting
		function scope
		local scope
		global scope
		
	javascript standards
		let keyword
		const keyword
	
	== vs ===
	double checks value
	
	triple check strict type
		datatypes
	type coercion
		explicit
			Number('3'), String(123), Boolean(2)
		implicit
			'3' * '2', 2
	Arrow functions
		=>
	
	<p>
	Make arrow function that takes 3 numbers and returns the largest one
	
	functions
	self invoking 
	anonymous function
	selectors
	closers
	
	Off to lunch.
	
	</p>
	<p>
	Back.
	We are looking at Object Hierarchy in Javascript.
	window is at the top.
	Take a look at this and become familiar- (not sure this is imp)
	
	We have done all internal javascript up to now.
	Now for external.
	
	add src="script.js" to the html file inside script tag.
	
	inline is when you add the function to occur inside the input type area.
	
	now we are done with javascript
	
	We did a test for SQL that I did well on.
	
	</p>
	<p>
	Now we are in individual breakout rooms working on project zero. Back in driver seat.
	
	I just crunched through and got my transfer function working.
	So now I have withdraw from account and transfer from one account to another working.
	I need to tinker with them to make them beautiful but I'm very happy with my progress so
	far.
	Think I've been leaning on my wrist too much because it feels slightly bruised.
	Will have to be conscious of this going forward.
	Anyways I'm excited.
	Basically I need to add:
	
		System-
			Reject transfers that might cause senders account to go below zero
				make sure accounts cant go below zero.
			Reject withdraw or deposit that results in negative balance
			
		Customer-
			Add a deposit to account function.
			View balance of a specific account
			Function to accept money transfer from another account
				?Is there a staging area for transfers?
		
		Employee:
			approve or reject an account
				?maybe this is just leave alone or delete? 
					unless I have staging area.
			view a customers bank accounts
				?does this mean a user can have more than one account?
			view a log of all transactions
				table of ALL transactions ever
	</p>

<h3>Evening:</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
<p>
	I'm back. JavaScript- What is a client side message? vs server side

	**** javascript is for: making webpages more interactive, client side
	validations, etc. to generate html dynamically to handle html element
	events create html file for javaScript

	<!--script type="text/javascript"-->
	var name="Richard"
	<!--for(i = 1; i <= 5; i++)-->
	{
	<!--document.write("<;h1>"+name)-->
	}
	<!--document.write("<;br/>");-->
	grade=100 document.write(name + "your grade is "+grade);
	<!--<;/script>-->

	right click and inspect to check for errors official name is -
	ECMAScript back from taking a minute with Y. Now we are working on
	Pzero Will real-time update. Going to leave it here for now as I want
	to be with yordana for a few moments. Great day of learning. Best to
	remember I need to fix the withdrawal function. Something to do with
	the userid not sending through properly.

</p>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>Going to try with flipping the times of day. Think it makes more
	sense. Good morning btw. 5:19a Been working straight through to 6:27.
	Going to take a break for a moment. Got my login and customer tables
	working together so they update at same time on register. Things are
	working out. **** Reminder to finish the coding quiz before tomorrow
	evening. On revaturepro. And class begins! jdbc- callable statements
	css CallableStatement used to call stored procedure Procedure is like a
	function but can return multiple values select * from product; CREATE
	OR REPLACE FUNCTION totalRecords() RETURNS integer AS $total$ declare
	total integer; BEGIN SELECT count(*) into total FROM product; RETURN
	total; END; $total$ LANGUAGE plpgsql; --call function select
	totalRecords(); ------------Procedure create or replace procedure
	transfer( sender int, receiver int, amount dec ) language plpgsql as $$
	begin --subtract from sender update accounts set balance - balance -
	amount where id = sender; == adding to receiver update accounts set
	balance = balance + amount where id = receiver; commit; end;$$ ---call
	procedure call transfer(1,2,2000); select * from accounts; Mohammad
	showed us how to create procedure in postgres Now we are learning how
	to call it in jdbc create class in jdbc_demos
	CallingProcedureFromJava.java main Scanner scanner = new
	Scanner(System.in); System.out.println("Enter the account number to
	debit the amount :"); int sender = scanner.nextInt();

	System.out.println("Enter the account number to credit the amount :");
	int reciever = scanner.nextInt(); System.out.println("Enter the ammount
	to be transfered :"); int amount = scanner.nextInt(); Connection
	connection = DBConnection.getConnection(); CallableStatement stat =
	connection.prepareCall("call transfer(?,?,?)") stat.setInt(1,sender);
	stat.setInt(2,reciever); stat.setInt(3,amount); stat.execute();

	System.out.println("Transfer done/completed"); **** WHAT IS THE USE OF
	CALLABLE STATEMENT? is an interface by which we can make a call to a
	procedure from our jdbc This is really useful too. now we are on to
	html, css, and javascript HTML hyper text markup language used for
	creating webpages markup language because it uses tags Mohammad is a
	memory Doctor the html page we created is just a page what is CSS and
	what is javascript? selector is element to be styled So far so good. I
	sort of hope we never have to dive to far into CSS, but I'm comfortable
	with the basics. Design just never feels that interesting to me. More
	into how things work and functionality. Let's see if I agree with that
	in 10 years. internal css external CSS create new file > name
	styles.css (but can be anything.css) copy and paste from internal to
	this file. write in individual .html files- <;link type="text/css"
	rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> just added background image to all
	pages on website. SQL and java are so much more interesting to me. how
	can I make this more interesting? Like making a database work is
	fascinating but making it pretty for a user isn't so thrilling. DOM is
	document object model inline css **** QC What is difference between
	Inline and Block Elements Inline is when it renders within the line
	itself span Block elements create a new line div, p, br, onto a 20
	minute break now. We are back 9:37a Cascading Style Sheets for styling
	HTML documents composed of: selectors HTML element like h3, h1, p
	declarations comprised of a property and a value surround by curly
	braces css properties border padding margin display position color
	text-align now we are creating classes in css written in style element
	with . before like .mycolor {} I just need to know how this will apply
	to our potential job to make the connection in my mind now we have a
	usecase: // doesnt seem like we are on this yet id attribute to specify
	style p#p1{ color: fuchsia; } classes are to be used exclusively with
	dot notation css selectors element id class universal attribute **** QC
	question- What are different types of css selectors element id class
	universal attribute grouping child Now on to lunch for an hour.</p>

<h2>23/02/22</h2>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
	5:47am and I'm ready to go. Last night I changed the menu option for
	banking app to reflect what Mohammad has. It doesn't make sense to
	provide options for withdrawl and deposit / transfer before someone has
	logged in. I've now switched over the variable accountName to username
	to match what I need for loggin in on BankDAO and BankDAOImpl. Now I'm
	modifying AddAccount method and checking the status of table with
	printAllAccount method. So I successfully add the add account function
	to my app, but that was for a test users table. Now I have to switch it
	over to the respective Employees and Customers tables depending on
	which they are. Class is starting now. <br /> <br /> Need to have
	clearer things to study after each day and load it into the
	learning-app. Like yesterday I took notes all day but dont have clear
	idea on what would be asked on QCs that needs to change. <br /> <br />
	**** JDBC terms and core concepts are important DAO - Data access
	Object Interfaces of JDBC **** <br /> <br /> Design Pattern Reusable
	solutions to common software development problems We use the DAO design
	pattern in our banking app to seperate the problem domain from the
	persistence mechanism. Uses interfaces to define an abstraction <br />
	<br /> We are taking some time to read about DAO Design Pattern here <a
		href="https://app.revature.com/curriculum/12767/batch/1211/viewCalendar">2/21</a>
	From my understanding it seperates the methods into an interface from
	the concrete class that accesses the database. Which allows you to
	switch out that concrete class for a different database if needed or
	whatever way you are accessing the data. <br /> <br /> Now we will
	create the delete function in project. Actually he wants to talk about
	statement and prepared statement **** QC Question! ^ <br /> <br /> Now
	to delete copy and paste the update code in ProductDAOImpl "delete from
	product where productId =?") statement.setInt(1, productId); <br /> <br />
	(rows + " deleted successfully") <br /> <br /> then ProductApp case 2:
	productId = scanner.nextInt(); productDAO.deleteProduct(productId);
	break; <br /> <br /> If you try to delete a product that isn't there
	you should handle that. If you try to update a product that isnt there
	you should handle at the moment entered. ^ create a method if product
	exists in ProductDAO.java public boolean isProductExists(int
	productId); <br /> <br /> copy code from searchProductByName to
	isProductExists <br /> <br /> public boolean isProductExists(int
	productId) { boolean productExists = false; PreparedStatement stat;
	try{ stat = con.prepareStatement("select * from product where productId
	= ? "); stat.setInt(1, productId); ResultSet res = stat.executeQuery();
	productExists = res.next(); } catch (SQLException e) {
	e.printStackTrace(); } return productExists; } <br /> <br /> now we
	will use JUnit testing to see if method works as we hope. <br /> <br />
	write test case- <br /> <br /> right click on DAOImpl create new>Test
	Case configure for 1.8 <br /> <br /> he's going really fast through
	this so someone will ask him to do it again- <br /> <br /> ProductDAO
	productDAO; @Afterall <br /> <br /> @BeforeEach void setUp() throws
	Exception { productDAO = new ProductDAOImpl(); } @Test
	@DisplayName("Testing product exists-1") void testIsProductExists() {
	int productID=2; boolean actual =
	productDAO.isProductExists(productId); assertTrue(actual); <br /> <br />
	@Test @DisplayName("Testing product exists-2") void
	testIsProductExists2() { int productID=2827; boolean actual =
	productDAO.isProductExists(productId); assertFalse(actual); } <br /> <br />
	@Test @DisplayName("Testing product exists-3") void
	testIsProductExists4() { int productID=20827; boolean actual =
	productDAO.isProductExists(productId); assertFalse(actual); } <br /> <br />
	That was tough to keep up with but I got through and can replicate for
	my own test cases in the bank app. Adding that now and will do delete
	if there's extra time. <br /> <br /> we cant test a method that is
	void. (i think) so we are changing our methods to return something.
	public boolean addProduct public boolean updateProduct public Product
	searchByProductId public List<;Product> searchByProductName public
	List<;Product> searchProductByPrice public List<;Product>
	getProducts(); (without semi colons above) public boolean
	isProductExists <br /> <br /> change for each in ProductDAOImpl
	initialize row=0 take away initialization at int rows =
	statement.executeUpdate(); <br /> <br /> if(rows==0) return false; else
	return true; <br /> <br /> he is adding them to codeshare for us- <ahref"https://codeshare.io/tufail">here</a>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	he is changing the searchByProductName code
	<br/>
	<br/>
	List<;Product> products = new ArrayList<;Product>();
	PreparedStatement stat'
	try{
			stat = connection.prepareStatement("select * from product where productName like ? ")
			stat.setString(1, productName);
	<br/>
	<br/>
	ResultSet res = stat.executeQuery();
	while(res.next()) {
		Product product = new Product();
		product.setProductId(res.getInt(1));
		product.setProductName(res.getString(2));
		product.setQuantityOnHand(res.getInt(3));
		product.setPrice(res.getInt(4));
		products.add(product);
	}
} catch (SQLException e) {
	e.printStackTrace();
}
	return products
<br/>
<br/>
now we change printAllProducts to
public void getProducts() {

}
<br/>
<br/>
change getProducts and searchProductsByPrice
<br/>
<br/>
going to 17 minute break and back at 9:35a
<br/>
<br/>
back from break and mohammad is flying.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm caught up now he is adding test cases for all methods-
<br/>
<br/>
@TestMethodOrder(value = MethodOrderer.OrderAnnotation.class)
<br/>
<br/>
	ProductDAO productDAO
	int productId;
	Product product;
<br/>
<br/>
	@BeforeEach
	void setUp() throws Exception {
		productDAO = new ProductDAOImpl();
		productId = 9999;
		product = new Product();
	}
	<br/>
	<br/>
	@Test
	@Order(value = 1)
	void testAddProduct() {
		Product product = new Product(productId, "Dummy", 10, 100);
		assertTrue(productDAO.addProduct(product));
	}
	<br/>
	<br/>
	@Test
	@Order(value = 2)
	void testSearchByProductId() {
		Product foundProduct = productDAO.searchByProductId(productId);
		product = new Product(productId, "Dummy", 10, 100);
		assertEquals(foundProduct, product);
	}
	<br/>
	<br/>
	@Test
	@Order(value = 3)
	void testUpdateProduct() {
		Product updatedProduct = new Product(productId, "NewDummy", 199, 90);
		productDAO.updateProduct(updatedProduct);
		assertTrue(productDAO.updateProduct(updatedProduct));
	}
	<br/>
	<br/>
	@Test
	@Order(value = 4)
	void testGetProducts() {
		List<;Product> products = productDAO.getProducts();
		assertNotEquals(0, products.size());
	}
	<br/>
	<br/>
	@Test
	@Order(value = 5)
	void testDeleteProduct() {
		assertTrue(productDAO.deleteProduct(productId));
	}
	<br/>
	<br/>
	go to DAOImpl
	<br/>
	<br/>
	searchProductById
	<br/>
	<br/>
	He is adding test code and Impl code to codeshare now.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	finish updating tests we went through together and finish the final 3 that we didn't.
	<br/>
	<br/>



</p>
<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
<p>

	Back from lunch All functions working properly and all tests. <br /> <br />
	Now we got to ProductApp.java and make sure all working there. <br /> <br />
	case 1: if(productDAO.isProductExists(productId)) {
	System.out.printlin("Product with product id : "+productId+" already
	exists, please try with another product id"); continue; } <br /> <br />
	result = productDAO.addProduct(product); if(result) {
	System.out.println("Congratulations, your product....") } else { "Sorry
	your product cannot be saved" } <br /> <br /> case 2:
	if(productDAO.isProductExists(productId)) {
	productDAO.deleteProduct(productId); "product deleted successfully"; }
	else { "product with product id : "+productId+" does not exist, hence
	it cannot be deleted." } <br /> <br /> case 3:
	if(!productDAO.isProductExists(productId)) { "product does not exist so
	could not be updated"; continue; }
	-------------------------------------------------------------- declare
	at top of ProductApp List<;Product> products = <br /> <br /> for case
	5: products = productDaO.searchByProductName(productName);
	printProductDetails(products); <br /> <br /> case 6: products =
	productDAO.getProducts(); printProductDetails(products); <br /> <br />
	case 7: <br /> <br /> products =
	productDAO.searchProductByPrice(lower,upper); <br /> <br />
	printProductDetails(products); break; <br /> <br /> outside the while
	loop and start product app <br /> <br /> public void
	printProductDetails(List<;Product> products) { Iterator<;Product>
	iterator = products.iterator(); while(iterator.hasNext()) { Product
	temp = iterator.next(); System.out.println(temp); } } <br /> <br />
	need to fix search by name to say "___ does not exist" if item does not
	exist if(products.size()==0) { System.out.println("No products matching
	your criteria"); continue; } <br /> <br /> case 4: <br /> <br /> copy
	code from delete code <br /> <br /> if
	(productDAO.isProductExists(productId)) { Product temp =
	productDAO.searchByProductId(productId); System.out.println(temp); } <br />
	<br /> So I think this project is basically fully functional. <br /> <br />
	All the menu items work, all the methods work, a few test cases. Need
	to finish this. But overall it was great building from scratch with
	Mohammad. He says log4j is optional for p zero but I really want to
	have it working. My plan is to have the full project done on Saturday.
	Code locked by Sunday morning. And then practice presenting it on
	Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. <br /> <br /> Mohammad is dropping
	knowledge on the project for login and validate. rewatch recording at
	2:50am his time. 1:25p my time. <br /> <br /> while(true) { 1. add user
	2. login "please enter your choice" choice = scanner.nextInt(); <br />
	<br /> switch } <br /> <br /> On a 20 minute break now. Mohammad just
	went into super hyper drive with what he shared. Everything super
	useful for our projects. I don't feel worried about anything now. Just
	have to put in the time. <br /> <br /> I'm jumping back in early to
	start taking more chunks out of this project. <br /> <br /> I'm hungry
	for it. <br /> <br /> So I got all the way through the Login build out
	to validating a user login. I will rewatch the video to follow that
	along. Really nice of him to provide that to us. Will not take for
	granted. Okay back into training. I'm so excited to do this on my own
	later. Future apologies to my wife and kids but this is so dope. <br />
	<br /> sql and jdbc quiz- open for 2 days <br /> <br /> hands on for
	right now: <br /> <br /> if you choose 1: please enter username: please
	enter password: <br /> <br /> congrats you are registered <br /> <br />
	then return to main menu <br /> <br /> please enter username: please
	enter password: <br /> <br /> if correct- welcome, joseph <br /> <br />
	product app menu <br /> <br /> my login isnt working correctly I will
	have to debug later <br /> <br /> He says to add a logout option to the
	menu once logged in. <br /> <br /> We are done with class for the day.
	Have to work on P0 and finish the quiz and update learning app. <br />
	<br /> tomorrow is jdbc, html, css, javascript.





</p>
<h3>Evening:</h3>
<p>I'm back. I wasted some time adding br's to the previous entries.
	not worth the effort. Maybe I can script something through the html?
	Anyways, I'm going to add some of the stuff Mohammad graced us with
	earlier. Going to go side by side from product-app-alstrom and get this
	working. Okay got my register user working. It was a simple mistake. I
	forgot to put login = new Login(userId, username, password); before
	passing the data to sql. My last thought before calling it a night is
	how to increment across all tables when i insert on 1. Like adding a
	login should add the info to employee and make sure customer knows the
	next available as well. Going to figure this out in the morning.</p>

<h2>22/02/22</h2>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
	5:50am- I see more clearly how to study and learn. Starting now. I'll
	go back and add the basics to my app. The core of Java and SQL and all
	other subjects we learn. Prioritize items to memorize based on what
	they are. I've been doing a blind study method that isn't working good
	enough. I added postgres dependency to pom.xml for learning-app and the
	Driver location to app.java. <br /> <br /> We are about to start this
	QC orientation. I don't know why we are doing this instead of studying
	as I feel I understand what QC's are for and how to improve at them,
	but will go in with open mind. It feels like we are already a bit
	behind covering material and yesterday we lost 4.5 hours to QC then we
	did lunch. By the time we came back we had 1.5 hours to learn. Anyways
	that's enough ranting. I'll update as it progresses. This is literally
	the same Orientation that we already sat through.... A little
	frustrating but let me see if there's anything I can learn from
	watching again. Some good tips: Watch how trainer debugs problems that
	happen. Write pseuodcode. Record yourself preparing for QC and watch
	the recording. <br /> <br /> Finished with the 2nd go at QC. It was
	actually nice to rehear some of the points again. I think if my batch
	mates are open to the suggestions they reiterated it would benefit all
	of us. Most of the answers I hear and I give sound like the average or
	poor answers and the goal is to get a job at the end of this. So I have
	a LOT of room to improve and will continue to make the effort to do so.
	<br /> <br /> Now we are in class with Mohammad. We are leaving the QC
	behind us and Mohammad will do 1:1 with each of us to communicate
	feedback. Now we are back into JDBC and preparing for everything we
	need to know for P0. Step 1: Load the appropriate driver Step 2: Create
	the connection url username password //java.sql package Connection con
	=
	DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres",
	"postgres", "admin"); //System.out.println("Connected"); add
	SQLException throws exception PRETTY SWEET WE ARE CONNECTED! Step 3:
	Statement stat = con.createStatement(); Step 4: ResultSet res =
	stat.executeQuery("select * from employees"); // takes the cursor to
	the next row // and returns false if no record is there
	while(res.next()) { System.out.println(res.getString(1)+ " ");
	System.out.println(res.getString(2)+ " ");
	System.out.print(res.getInt("salary")+ " ");
	System.out.println(res.getString("email")); } // closing the resultset,
	statement and connection res.close(); stat.close(); con.close(); //make
	sure you have imports for SQL //Do we have anyway by which we can
	retrieve the column information ResultSetMetaData rsmd =
	res.getMetaData(); int columnCount = rsmd.getColumnCount(); // printing
	the column names for (int i = 1; i<=columnCount; i++){
	System.out.print(rsmd.getColumnName(i)+" "); } System.out.println(); //
	printing all the values of the table for (int i =1; i <= columnCount;
	i++) { System.out.print(res.getString(i) + " "); }
	System.out.println(); ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ that is SWEEEEEEET 22:32p he says
	DEFINITION QC Answer for metadata We are now back from a 23 minute
	break Now we are learning about insert and update as well. Create
	another class called InsertDemo //driver //connection Instead of
	writing the driver and connection in each class we will use a method
	and call the method in .utility package DBConnection public static
	Connection getConnection() { Connection con = null; try{
	Class.forName("org.postgresql.Driver"); con =
	DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres",
	"postgres", "admin"); } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
	e.printStackTrace(); } catch (SQLException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }
	return con; } now we write Connection con =
	DBConnection.getConnection(); I had this thought earlier but it feels
	like Mohammad is giving us superpowers. And it's a really nice feeling.

	use case: how can a customer change password without downloading java?
	we should be able to change the password and other details without
	changing our code. Externalize the properties in a file. properties
	file go to a drive and create notepad file username=postgres
	password=root driver=org.postgresql.Driver
	url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres saves as
	"revaturedb.properties" then we read it from eclipse try { FileReader
	rdr = new FileReader("revaturedb.properties"); Properties properties =
	new Properties(); properties.load(rdr); String driver =
	properties.getProperty("driver"); String url =
	properties.getProperty("url"); String username =
	properties.getProperty("username"); String password =
	properties.getProperty("password"); Class.forName(driver); con =
	DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password); } catch
	(FileNotFoundException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } catch (SQLException)
	{ e.printStackTrace(); } Mohammad just show us how to create a
	properties file so that we can have username, password, driver, and url
	in external file for easy changes. So this is awesome and basically
	answers the question for password security when adding database
	projects to github. to always hide the file that includes passwords or
	sensitive data. I remember googling this while living in Mexico and
	feeling like I was just copying and pastying until I could get
	something to work. It's so nice to be introduced to this from a place
	of understanding. go to product-app-alstrom app run it and try 6. open
	pom.xml and add postgres dependency create package-
	com.training.pms.utility copy DBConnection.java and paste into this
	project's utility package copy revaturedb.properties and paste into
	this project got to DAOImpl and add at top- Connection connection =
	DBConnection.getConnection();


	------------------------------------------------ copy and paste
	Statement and ResultSet stuff Statement stat = null; create case 6:


	Mohammad says we will be ready to go for creating skeleton for P zero,
	but now we have lunch. After an associates problem is resolved.
	Actually we will do after lunch. See you then.


</p>
<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
<p>I'm back and ready to keep learning. in DAOImpl copy and paste
	Statement state and ResultSet and while loop with res.next() into this
	project put entire thing inside one try catch block now you have to
	call the method in ProductApp.java case 6:
	productDAO.printAllProducts(); Now we are able to print all products in
	this previous made product-app-alstrom project. It's very cool how this
	happens and things clicking together for Java and SQL through JDBC and
	postgres. hands on exercise: DBEAVER insert into product values
	(3,'Aroma',199,99); insert into product values (4,'Mouse',12,6); select
	* from product where productName like 'Mouse'; try to search for a
	product by name and return Enter the product name : _____ Here are the
	details for : _____ copy and paste code from printAllProducts to
	searchByProductName change to stat.executeQuery("select * from product
	where productName like '"+productName+"'"); create case 5:
	System.out.println("Please enter product name to search :");
	productName = scanner.next();
	productDAO.searchByProductName(productName);

	-------------------------------------------------------------- now we
	are able to search by name in a database.....sweet. got it working in
	my bank app too. just need to add the bank tables in database enter the
	price (lower) : 3000 enter the price (upper) : 5000 SQL - "select *
	from product where price between" +lower+" and "+ upper prepared
	statements- **** IMPORTANT QC AND INTERVIEW QUESTION @ 2:51am
	difference between Statement and PreparedStatement Interfaces Statement
	interface is used for executing static SQL statements.

	PreparedStatement gives us the flexibility of specifying paramenters
	with the ? symbol. if you have static SQL use statement if you have
	parameters then you use PreparedStatement replace Statement stat with
	PreparedStatement stat stat = connection.prepareStatement("select *
	from product where productName like ? "); stat.setString(l,
	productName); ResultSet res = stat.executeQuery();

	-------------------------------------------------------------- talking
	about the DAO **** DAO - data access objects add to ProductDAO.java
	interface public void searchProductByPrice(int lowerprice, int
	upperprice); copy code from searchProductByName private final SQL_QUERY
	stat = con.prepareStatement("select * from product where price between
	? and ?"); stat.setInt(1,lowerprice); stat.setInt(2,upperprice); add
	case 7: to search by price (lower/upper) case 7:
	System.out.println("Please enter product price (lower) :"); int
	lowerprice = scanner.nextInt(); System.out.println("Please enter
	product price (upper) :"); int upperprice = scanner.nextInt();
	productDAO.searchProductByPrice(lowerprice,upperprice); break;
	------------------------------------------ now for inserting into
	postgres fom maven we already wrote in ProductApp ProductDAOImpl.java
	statement = con.prepareStatement("insert into product
	values(?,?,?,?)"); statement.setInt(1, product.getProductId());
	statement.setString(2, product.getProductName()); statement.setInt(3,
	product.getQuantityOnHand()); statement.setInt(4, product.getPrice());

	int rows = statement.executeUpdate(); System.out.println(rows+"
	inserted successfully") surround in try catch block so dope Mohammad
	just showed us how to insert from Eclipse We are in full connected
	mode!!! Now we are checking update as well. It's already written in
	ProductApp.java Go to Impl copy and paste from add product to update
	product connection.prepareStatement("update product set productName =
	?, quantityonhand = ?, price = ? where productId = ?");

	statement.setString(1, product.getProductName()); statement.setInt(2,
	product.getQuantityOnHand()); statement.setInt(3, product.getPrice());
	statement.setInt(4, product.getProductId()); int rows =
	statement.executeUpdate(); System.out.println(rows+" updated
	successfully") write in postgres first to check you are getting it
	right. copy and paste replace amounts with ?s. done for the day. Very
	happy with what we learned and feel ready to complete huge chunks of P
	zero.</p>
<h3>Evening:</h3>
<p>And here we are in the evening. 4:54pm. Going to make the updates
	to bank app that we learned in our product app during class today and
	create table. I added the table and will see how it connects in the
	morning.</p>

<h2>21/02/22</h2>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
	Starting QC now! Wish me luck. <br /> Think I did well but definitely
	got the answer wrong a bit. My questions were what is Maven? Where does
	Maven get dependencies from? What are scalar and aggregate functions in
	SQL? The correct answer is Scalar functions perform an operation on
	values returned from a query. Such as UCASE(), LCASE(), LENGTH(),
	ROUND(). Aggregate functions calculate on a set of values and return a
	single value. Some examples are: AVG(), COUNT(), MIN(), MAX(), SUM().

	Here are some questions for other people: What is difference between
	WHERE and HAVING? What is POM.xml used for? What are some SQL
	datatypes? Define method overloading and method overriding? What is a
	wrapper class? What is SQL and why is it important for us as
	developers? What is a schema? (name removed) does a good job of
	creating a story when answering. Something to use when knowing the
	answer. What is a transaction? What properties must a transaction
	follow? What are generics? Write an example of generics. Can you tell
	me the difference between a List and a Set? What is a map in Java?
	Difference between ALTER and UPDATE commands? What is a JOIN? <br /> <br />
	THE ART OF THE ANSWER: Answer with correct answer AND give GREAT
	example personal to my RECENT experience. The correct answer alone does
	not prove I know the answer. DONT: Say I think, UMM, I believe, that's
	my best guess, I'm not sure, I don't know. Even if you don't know, no
	one cares. Respond like you know and you have a chance of being right.
	Humility does not matter in an interview they are making an investment
	on you and your ability. <br /> I'm going to do better on the next QC
	or project presentation. I know how to do better. <br /> It's been
	taking a while for this QC. Started at 7am my time and now it's 11:31.
	Not sure if that's a bad sign, but I hope my fellow classmates are safe
	and our teacher too. The topics we've went over take a lot of repition
	and hands on experience. Let's see what happens but the anticipation is
	killing me.

</p>
<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
<p>
	We are going to start the day after QC with a coding challenge. Coding
	challenge was pretty easy. Now we are learning JDBC so we have it for
	building out projects. Java Database Connectivity Connects Java to
	SQL/Database GUI and CUI to DB to have the proper drivers for postgres
	to talk with JAVA you to- Class.forName("org.postgresql.Driver"); throw
	an exception for it Very cool that all we have to do is add the
	dependency code to the pom.xml file and poof. It's connected. Next I
	assume we go to DBeaver and connect from there. This stuff is dope. <a
		href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.postgresql/postgresql/42.3.3">JDBC
		Driver</a> and some documentation fun- <a
		href="https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/80/connect.html">JDBC
		Docs</a> also I am trying to fit in the HTC (how to code) course in the
	free time that doesn't exist. I know it creates good practices. <a
		href="https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:UBCx+HtC1x+2T2017/home">HTC
		Simple Data</a> Overloading is process by which we have same method name
	and different parameters. What is difference between abstract class and
	interface? Maven gets dependencies from. What is driver? What is types
	of driver? Going to take a breather after this class and get back in
	later on to update my learning app. I think I mainly feel there are so
	many individual things to memorize for QCs that I don't get a strong
	handle on what is asked. As Mohammad said.. instead of trying to
	memorize things word for word I'm going to take the most important
	points and know them in and out entirely. The core fundamentals. When
	he brought up the question about differencies between abstract class
	and interface it leaves me somewhat unsure... like I could answer the
	memorized answer when it was asked 3 weeks ago, but now I just know an
	interface allows for multiple inheritance and abstract classes must
	have their methods implemented by child classes.. is that right? After
	looking <a
		href="https://www.javatpoint.com/difference-between-abstract-class-and-interface">here</a>
	I think the correct answer is- Abstract class can have abstract and
	non-abstract methods. Interface can only have abstract methods.
	Interface supports multiple inheritance and abstract classes do not.
	Abstract class can implement an interface but interface cant implement
	an abstract class. Interface can only extend another interface. Maybe I
	do the definition with workable examples as I talked about before. Okay
	that's enough! See you later.

<div id="Diary">
	<span class="name">Diary</span> section.
</div>
<!-- POST Diary entries below -->

<h2>20/02/22</h2>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>It's 5:35am on a Sunday and I need to memorize 100 ideas from the
	last week. I need to break it into smaller fun chunks of information.
	My imagination has to take over to make this work. Let's see what I
	have available.</p>
<p>
	I had this idea for a video game style learning adventure. It would
	probably translate well to VR. Immersive walk through experience. Like
	you enter your memory area a place special to you. A place you know.
	And then the game develops ideas based on what you need to learn and in
	the best way for you to learn. Some ideas are people and groups of
	people with personalities, some ideas are buildings or homes, some are
	objects, some are billboards, some are a videogame within a videogame,
	it's endless. Where is your infinite well of knowledge and how can it
	be made visual? I'm a visual learner so it's a necessity for me. Track
	where it is in your brain based on your interactions. Instead of
	feeling like you are being quizzed it's like walking up to someone and
	trying to remember their name. A different type of pressure. Can I
	start now? How best to do so? Just to start I suppose. It starts in
	eclipse. I've built out the learning project similar to our banking app
	example. I want it to feel and work great, but I don't know how to
	think about doing it. And I worry that just by starting I'm going to
	make mistakes that would save me headaches in the future. I think at
	this stage of my learning this is inevitable and I just have to
	continue. So anyways I've made a App class that creats a LearnApp
	object to call the startLearnApp method. This keeps App.java as basic
	as possible and opens from my custom class of LearnApp.java. I then
	created a Learn.java class that I will use as my model. <br /> Honestly
	doing this is freightening. <br /> The amount of mistakes I can make is
	infinite, but this is better than index cards in my mind. So it's worth
	testing. Looking at the BankDAO.java class I can add methods to this
	app in a LearnDAO.java for: public void addMemoryItem(Learn item);
	public void updateMemoryItem(Learn item); public void
	deleteMemoryItem(int memoryId); public void searchByMemoryId(int
	memoryId); public void searchByMemoryName(String memoryName); public
	void printAllMemoryItems(); <br /> but I'm going to save this for
	later. I just want to fill this with information that I need now. I
	ended up just building out LearnDAO.java and LearnDAOImpl.java because
	it was too easy not to. Now I am faced with buildng a new object for
	each memory area or doing it all in LearnApp.java... My gut tells me to
	do a new class for each area. Let me try that and see how it goes. <br />
	I'm back at the desk after family woke up. Debating on attending an
	OSSU cohort that meets in 4 minutes. I dont want to take on anything
	that distracts me, but maybe it could be fresh? Idk. Couldnt hurt to
	try 1 and see how it goes. I've tried before in the past but didn't
	feel it pulling me along like I needed. <br /> Just went on a long
	Maven run with creating a learning-app project and injesting all the
	data into it. I now have a project I can build dynamically week after
	week. I kind of suprised myself a bit with this one and am happy with
	the outcome. I can add it to github so I can study from my other
	computer as well.

<h2>18/02/22</h2>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
	Downloaded atom on this windows so I can diary my thoughts a bit
	better. I've been trying to keep notes but theyve been a bit bare.
	Let's see if this helps. Most of what we are learning right now is to
	build our bank app. Which is project 0 in this training course. We are
	using SQL Shell for postgresql alongside with DBeaver to show how
	running multiple threads can cause a lock up. We just looked at
	savepoints between updates and inserts so that we can rollback to
	specific points. This is new for me. <br /> <br /> To study: 4 levels
	of isolation we can select for RDBMS- <br /> Serializable <br />
	Repeatable Reads <br /> Read Committed <br /> Read Uncommitted <br /> <br />
	Now we are done talking about transactions. On to DDL: Truncate,
	create, alter, drop. Now we are learning about creating a table and
	inserting items. It's cool because we are able to check in the SQL
	Shell as we do so. We just used primary key, unique, and check to
	create constraints for the items we are adding to table. The DBeaver
	was doing some weird things when trying to create and drop tables with
	the Auto-Commit disabled for Manual Committ (Read Committed). This is
	something to be aware of when building out tables for Bank project. On
	to our first 20 minute break. Good day so far. Having music on in the
	background makes a huge difference for me. I've disabled spell check
	and trying to remove the autocomplete without making it a hassle to
	write inside here. Back to listening to Mohammad. Now we are learning
	about auto incrementing for primary key into table. Using serial,
	sequence. Sequence is nice because you can modify the start and
	increment amount. <br /> Feeling pretty good about this table stuff.
	I'm having some fun with it by using my Philadelphia friend's names. I
	need to do that more often to get comfortable. Now we are on to
	Normalization- Helps us to break the table into different parts We are
	moving to foreign keys because he cant find document pertaining to
	normalization. When the primary key of one table is available in
	another as a non primary key column-> foreign key. Foreign key is very
	easy to understand. Sort of like a door from one table to another. I
	feel like we get way too much time to do the examples. We could do
	twice as many. Why not give us the proposed example as well as an
	advanced example for those of us moving a bit faster? I find myself
	either trying to find examples online or my mind wandering a bit at
	leaset 25% of the class. on delete cascade is used for a child table to
	delete all referenced instances when using delete from students where
	studentId = 211; ^my specific example. Next QC is on Monday from 10am -
	12pm EST. Week 2: Maven Git Wrapper Classes Abstract Interfaces
	StringBuilder String Buffer Overloading CollectionAPI Unit Testing
	JUnit Week 3: Postgres 2/16 all but normalization 2/17 no JDBC nothing
	on 2/18 referential integrity constraints data types TCL <br />
	Mohammad updated the curriculum found here: <a
		href="https://app.revature.com/curriculum/12767/batch/1211/viewCalendar">HERE</a>
	<br /> After break we will cover rest of topics and prepare for QC. SQL
	Quiz questions QC questions Mohammad will share with us. <br /> <br />
	Possible QC QuestionS: What is referential integrity? <br /> <br />
	ALTER TABLE statements to add, drop, Alter makes changes to table
	structure Update makes changes to values/data On to Set Operators Union

	Union All Intersect returns the same items from each table Except/Minus
	returns distinct rows selected by 1st query not present in 2nd query.

	Have all the QC resources from Mohammad saved to ->
	C:\Users\Winterfam\Desktop\Revature\QC_PREPARE\QC_Week2_Week3 Im using
	GIT on here to push to my github repo. I like the public nature of what
	I am doing being open to anyone, anytime. Back from another 20 minute
	break that I spent at my computer. <br /> Back to normalization- to
	reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. and we are done for
	the day. I'll be back to prepare notes / index cards for the QC
