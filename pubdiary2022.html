<h2>21/02/22</h2>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
	Starting QC now! Wish me luck.
	<br/>
	Think I did well but definitely got the answer wrong a bit.
	My questions were what is Maven?
	Where does Maven get dependencies from?
	What are scalar and aggregate functions in SQL?

	The correct answer is Scalar functions perform an operation on values returned from a query.
	Such as UCASE(), LCASE(), LENGTH(), ROUND().
	Aggregate functions calculate on a set of values and return a single value.
	Some examples are: AVG(), COUNT(), MIN(), MAX(), SUM().

	Here are some questions for other people:
	What is difference between WHERE and HAVING?
	What is POM.xml used for?
	What are some SQL datatypes?
	Define method overloading and method overriding?
	What is a wrapper class?
	What is SQL and why is it important for us as developers?
	What is a schema?

	(name removed) does a good job of creating a story when answering.
	Something to use when knowing the answer.
	What is a transaction?
	What properties must a transaction follow?
	What are generics?
	Write an example of generics.
	Can you tell me the difference between a List and a Set?
	What is a map in Java?
	Difference between ALTER and UPDATE commands?
	What is a JOIN?

	<br/>
	<br/>
	THE ART OF THE ANSWER:
	Answer with correct answer AND give GREAT example personal to my RECENT experience.
	The correct answer alone does not prove I know the answer.

	DONT: Say I think, UMM, I believe, that's my best guess, I'm not sure, I don't know.
	Even if you don't know, no one cares. Respond like you know and you have a chance of being right.
	Humility does not matter in an interview they are making an investment on you and your ability.

	<br/>
	I'm going to do better on the next QC or project presentation. I know how to do better.
	<br/>
	It's been taking a while for this QC. Started at 7am my time and now it's 11:31.
	Not sure if that's a bad sign, but I hope my fellow classmates are safe and our teacher too.
	The topics we've went over take a lot of repition and hands on experience.
	Let's see what happens but the anticipation is killing me.

<h2>20/02/22</h2>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>It's 5:35am on a Sunday and I need to memorize 100 ideas from the last week.
	I need to break it into smaller fun chunks of information.
	My imagination has to take over to make this work.
	Let's see what I have available.
</p>
<p>
	I had this idea for a video game style learning adventure.
	It would probably translate well to VR. Immersive walk through experience.
	Like you enter your memory area a place special to you. A place you know.
	And then the game develops ideas based on what you need to learn and in the
	best way for you to learn. Some ideas are people and groups of people with
	personalities, some ideas are buildings or homes, some are objects,
	some are billboards, some are a videogame within a videogame, it's endless.
	Where is your infinite well of knowledge and how can it be made visual?
	I'm a visual learner so it's a necessity for me.
	Track where it is in your brain based on your interactions.
	Instead of feeling like you are being quizzed it's like walking up to someone
	and trying to remember their name. A different type of pressure.
	Can I start now? How best to do so? Just to start I suppose.
	It starts in eclipse.

	I've built out the learning project similar to our banking app example.
	I want it to feel and work great, but I don't know how to think about doing it.
	And I worry that just by starting I'm going to make mistakes that would save me headaches in the future.
	I think at this stage of my learning this is inevitable and I just have to continue.
	So anyways I've made a App class that creats a LearnApp object to call the startLearnApp method.
	This keeps App.java as basic as possible and opens from my custom class of LearnApp.java.
	I then created a Learn.java class that I will use as my model.
	<br/> Honestly doing this is freightening.
	<br/>
	The amount of mistakes I can make is infinite, but this is better than index cards in my mind.
	So it's worth testing.
	Looking at the BankDAO.java class I can add methods to this app in a LearnDAO.java for:
	public void addMemoryItem(Learn item);
	public void updateMemoryItem(Learn item);
	public void deleteMemoryItem(int memoryId);
	public void searchByMemoryId(int memoryId);
	public void searchByMemoryName(String memoryName);
	public void printAllMemoryItems();
	<br/> but I'm going to save this for later. I just want to fill this with information that I need now.
	I ended up just building out LearnDAO.java and LearnDAOImpl.java because it was too easy not to.
	Now I am faced with buildng a new object for each memory area or doing it all in LearnApp.java...
	My gut tells me to do a new class for each area. Let me try that and see how it goes.
	<br/>
	I'm back at the desk after family woke up.
	Debating on attending an OSSU cohort that meets in 4 minutes. I dont want to take on anything that
	distracts me, but maybe it could be fresh? Idk. Couldnt hurt to try 1 and see how it goes.
	I've tried before in the past but didn't feel it pulling me along like I needed.
	<br/>
	Just went on a long Maven run with creating a learning-app project and injesting all the data
	into it. I now have a project I can build dynamically week after week.
	I kind of suprised myself a bit with this one and am happy with the outcome.
	I can add it to github so I can study from my other computer as well.

<h2>18/02/22</h2>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p> Downloaded atom on this windows so I can diary my thoughts a bit better.
	I've been trying to keep notes but theyve been a bit bare. Let's see if this helps.
	Most of what we are learning right now is to build our bank app.
	Which is project 0 in this training course.
	We are using SQL Shell for postgresql alongside with DBeaver to show how
	running multiple threads can cause a lock up.
	We just looked at savepoints between updates and inserts so that we can
	rollback to specific points. This is new for me.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	To study:
	4 levels of isolation we can select for RDBMS-
	<br/>
	Serializable
	<br/>
	Repeatable Reads
	<br/>
	Read Committed
	<br/>
	Read Uncommitted
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Now we are done talking about transactions.
	On to DDL: Truncate, create, alter, drop.
	Now we are learning about creating a table and inserting items.
	It's cool because we are able to check in the SQL Shell as we do so.
	We just used primary key, unique, and check to create constraints for the
	items we are adding to table.
	The DBeaver was doing some weird things when trying to create and drop
	tables with the Auto-Commit disabled for Manual Committ (Read Committed).
	This is something to be aware of when building out tables for Bank project.
	On to our first 20 minute break. Good day so far.
	Having music on in the background makes a huge difference for me.
	I've disabled spell check and trying to remove the autocomplete without making it
	a hassle to write inside here.
	Back to listening to Mohammad.
	Now we are learning about auto incrementing for primary key into table.
	Using serial, sequence.
	Sequence is nice because you can modify the start and increment amount.
	<br/>
	Feeling pretty good about this table stuff.
	I'm having some fun with it by using my Philadelphia friend's names.
	I need to do that more often to get comfortable.
	Now we are on to Normalization-

	Helps us to break the table into different parts

	We are moving to foreign keys because he cant find document pertaining to normalization.
	When the primary key of one table is available in another as a non primary key column-> foreign key.
	Foreign key is very easy to understand. Sort of like a door from one table
	to another.

	I feel like we get way too much time to do the examples. We could do twice as many.
	Why not give us the proposed example as well as an advanced example for those
	of us moving a bit faster? I find myself either trying to find examples
	online or my mind wandering a bit at leaset 25% of the class.

	on delete cascade is used for a child table to delete all referenced
	instances when using delete from students where studentId = 211;
	^my specific example.

	Next QC is on Monday from 10am - 12pm EST.

	Week 2:
	Maven
	Git
	Wrapper Classes
	Abstract
	Interfaces
	StringBuilder String Buffer
	Overloading

	CollectionAPI
	Unit Testing
	JUnit

	Week 3:
	Postgres
	2/16 all but normalization
	2/17 no JDBC
	nothing on 2/18
	referential integrity
	constraints
	data types
	TCL
	<br/>
	Mohammad updated the curriculum found here: <a href="https://app.revature.com/curriculum/12767/batch/1211/viewCalendar">HERE</a>
	<br/>
	After break we will cover rest of topics and prepare for QC.

	SQL Quiz questions

	QC questions Mohammad will share with us.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Possible QC QuestionS:

	What is referential integrity?

	<br/>
	<br/>
	ALTER TABLE statements to add, drop,

	Alter makes changes to table structure
	Update makes changes to values/data

	On to Set Operators

	Union

	Union All

	Intersect returns the same items from each table

	Except/Minus returns distinct rows selected by 1st query not present in 2nd query.

	Have all the QC resources from Mohammad saved to -> C:\Users\Winterfam\Desktop\Revature\QC_PREPARE\QC_Week2_Week3

	Im using GIT on here to push to my github repo. I like the public nature
	of what I am doing being open to anyone, anytime.

	Back from another 20 minute break that I spent at my computer.
	<br/>
	Back to normalization-
		to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.
		and we are done for the day. I'll be back to prepare notes / index cards
		for the QC
