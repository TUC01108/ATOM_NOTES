<h2>00/02/22</h2>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>5:47am and I'm ready to go. Last night I changed the menu option for banking app to reflect what Mohammad has.
	It doesn't make sense to provide options for withdrawl and deposit / transfer before someone has logged in.
	I've now switched over the variable accountName to username to match what I need for loggin in on BankDAO and BankDAOImpl.
	Now I'm modifying AddAccount method and checking the status of table with printAllAccount method.
	So I successfully add the add account function to my app, but that was for a test users table.
	Now I have to switch it over to the respective Employees and Customers tables depending on which they are.
	Class is starting now.

	Need to have clearer things to study after each day and load it into the learning-app.
	Like yesterday I took notes all day but dont have clear idea on what would be asked on QCs that needs to change.

	**** JDBC terms and core concepts are important
	DAO - Data access Object
	Interfaces of JDBC
	****

	Design Pattern
		Reusable solutions to common software development problems
		We use the DAO design pattern in our banking app to seperate the problem domain from the persistence mechanism.
		Uses interfaces to define an abstraction

	We are taking some time to read about DAO Design Pattern here <a href="https://app.revature.com/curriculum/12767/batch/1211/viewCalendar">2/21</a>
	From my understanding it seperates the methods into an interface from the concrete class that accesses the database.
	Which allows you to switch out that concrete class for a different database if needed or whatever way you are accessing the data.

	Now we will create the delete function in project.
	Actually he wants to talk about statement and prepared statement
	**** QC Question! ^

	Now to delete
	copy and paste the update code in ProductDAOImpl
	"delete from product where productId =?")
	statement.setInt(1, productId);

	(rows + " deleted successfully")

	then ProductApp
	case 2:
		productId = scanner.nextInt();
		productDAO.deleteProduct(productId);
		break;

	If you try to delete a product that isn't there you should handle that.
	If you try to update a product that isnt there you should handle at the moment entered.
	^
	create a method if product exists in
	ProductDAO.java
	public boolean isProductExists(int productId);

	copy code from searchProductByName to isProductExists

	public boolean isProductExists(int productId) {
		boolean productExists = false;
		PreparedStatement stat;
		try{
			stat = con.prepareStatement("select * from product where productId = ? ");
			stat.setInt(1, productId);

			ResultSet res = stat.executeQuery();
			productExists = res.next();
		}
			catch (SQLException e) {
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
			return productExists;
	}

	now we will use JUnit testing to see if method works as we hope.

	write test case-

	right click on DAOImpl create new>Test Case
	configure for 1.8

	he's going really fast through this so someone will ask him to do it again-

	ProductDAO productDAO;
	@Afterall

	@BeforeEach
	void setUp() throws Exception {
		productDAO = new ProductDAOImpl();
	}
	@Test
	@DisplayName("Testing product exists-1")
	void testIsProductExists() {
		int productID=2;
		boolean actual = productDAO.isProductExists(productId);
		assertTrue(actual);

	@Test
	@DisplayName("Testing product exists-2")
	void testIsProductExists2() {
		int productID=2827;
		boolean actual = productDAO.isProductExists(productId);
		assertFalse(actual);
	}

	@Test
	@DisplayName("Testing product exists-3")
	void testIsProductExists4() {
		int productID=20827;
		boolean actual = productDAO.isProductExists(productId);
		assertFalse(actual);
	}

	That was tough to keep up with but I got through and can replicate for my own test cases in the bank app.
	Adding that now and will do delete if there's extra time.

	we cant test a method that is void. (i think)
	so we are changing our methods to return something.
	public boolean addProduct
	public boolean updateProduct
	public Product searchByProductId
	public List<;Product> searchByProductName
	public List<;Product> searchProductByPrice
	public List<;Product> getProducts();
	(without semi colons above)
	public boolean isProductExists

	change for each in ProductDAOImpl
	initialize row=0
	take away initialization at int rows = statement.executeUpdate();

	if(rows==0)
		return false;
	else
		return true;

	he is adding them to codeshare for us- <a href"https://codeshare.io/tufail">here</a>

	he is changing the searchByProductName code

	List<;Product> products = new ArrayList<;Product>();
	PreparedStatement stat'
	try{
			stat = connection.prepareStatement("select * from product where productName like ? ")
			stat.setString(1, productName);

	ResultSet res = stat.executeQuery();
	while(res.next()) {
		Product product = new Product();
		product.setProductId(res.getInt(1));
		product.setProductName(res.getString(2));
		product.setQuantityOnHand(res.getInt(3));
		product.setPrice(res.getInt(4));
		products.add(product);
	}
} catch (SQLException e) {
	e.printStackTrace();
}
	return products

now we change printAllProducts to
public void getProducts() {

}

change getProducts and searchProductsByPrice

going to 17 minute break and back at 9:35a

back from break and mohammad is flying.

I'm caught up now he is adding test cases for all methods-

@TestMethodOrder(value = MethodOrderer.OrderAnnotation.class)

	ProductDAO productDAO
	int productId;
	Product product;

	@BeforeEach
	void setUp() throws Exception {
		productDAO = new ProductDAOImpl();
		productId = 9999;
		product = new Product();
	}

	@Test
	@Order(value = 1)
	void testAddProduct() {
		Product product = new Product(productId, "Dummy", 10, 100);
		assertTrue(productDAO.addProduct(product));
	}

	@Test
	@Order(value = 2)
	void testSearchByProductId() {
		Product foundProduct = productDAO.searchByProductId(productId);
		product = new Product(productId, "Dummy", 10, 100);
		assertEquals(foundProduct, product);
	}

	@Test
	@Order(value = 3)
	void testUpdateProduct() {
		Product updatedProduct = new Product(productId, "NewDummy", 199, 90);
		productDAO.updateProduct(updatedProduct);
		assertTrue(productDAO.updateProduct(updatedProduct));
	}

	@Test
	@Order(value = 4)
	void testGetProducts() {
		List<;Product> products = productDAO.getProducts();
		assertNotEquals(0, products.size());
	}

	@Test
	@Order(value = 5)
	void testDeleteProduct() {
		assertTrue(productDAO.deleteProduct(productId));
	}

	go to DAOImpl

	searchProductById

	He is adding test code and Impl code to codeshare now.

	finish updating tests we went through together and finish the final 3 that we didn't.

<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Evening:</h3>
<p>
</p>

<h2>22/02/22</h2>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
	5:50am-
	I see more clearly how to study and learn. Starting now. I'll go back and add the basics to my app.
	The core of Java and SQL and all other subjects we learn. Prioritize items to memorize based on what they are.
	I've been doing a blind study method that isn't working good enough.
	I added postgres dependency to pom.xml for learning-app and the Driver location to app.java.
	<br/>
	We are about to start this QC orientation. I don't know why we are doing this instead of studying as
	I feel I understand what QC's are for and how to improve at them, but will go in with open mind.
	It feels like we are already a bit behind covering material and yesterday we lost 4.5 hours to QC then we did lunch.
	By the time we came back we had 1.5 hours to learn.
	Anyways that's enough ranting. I'll update as it progresses.
	This is literally the same Orientation that we already sat through....
	A little frustrating but let me see if there's anything I can learn from watching again.
	Some good tips:
	Watch how trainer debugs problems that happen.
	Write pseuodcode.
	Record yourself preparing for QC and watch the recording.

	<br/>
	Finished with the 2nd go at QC. It was actually nice to rehear some of the points again.
	I think if my batch mates are open to the suggestions they reiterated it would benefit all of us.
	Most of the answers I hear and I give sound like the average or poor answers and the goal is to get a job
	at the end of this. So I have a LOT of room to improve and will continue to make the effort to do so.
	<br/>
	Now we are in class with Mohammad.

	We are leaving the QC behind us and Mohammad will do 1:1 with each of us to communicate feedback.
	Now we are back into JDBC and preparing for everything we need to know for P0.

	Step 1:
	Load the appropriate driver

	Step 2:
	Create the connection
		url
		username
		password

	//java.sql package
	Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres", "postgres", "admin");
	//System.out.println("Connected");
	add SQLException throws exception

	PRETTY SWEET WE ARE CONNECTED!

	Step 3:
	Statement stat = con.createStatement();

	Step 4:
	ResultSet res = stat.executeQuery("select * from employees");

	// takes the cursor to the next row
	// and returns false if no record is there
	while(res.next())
	{

	System.out.println(res.getString(1)+ "   ");
	System.out.println(res.getString(2)+ "   ");
	System.out.print(res.getInt("salary")+ "   ");
	System.out.println(res.getString("email"));
	}

	// closing the resultset, statement and connection
	res.close();
	stat.close();
	con.close();

	//make sure you have imports for SQL

	//Do we have anyway by which we can retrieve the column information
	ResultSetMetaData rsmd = res.getMetaData();
	int columnCount = rsmd.getColumnCount();

	// printing the column names
	for (int i = 1; i<=columnCount; i++){
		System.out.print(rsmd.getColumnName(i)+"    ");
	}
	System.out.println();

	// printing all the values of the table
	for (int i =1; i <= columnCount; i++) {
		System.out.print(res.getString(i) + "    ");
	}
	System.out.println();

	^^^^^^^^^^^^^ that is SWEEEEEEET

	22:32p he says DEFINITION QC Answer for metadata

	We are now back from a 23 minute break

	Now we are learning about insert and update as well.

	Create another class called InsertDemo

	//driver
	//connection

	Instead of writing the driver and connection in each class we will use a method and call the method
	in .utility package
	DBConnection
	public static Connection getConnection() {
		Connection con = null;
		try{
			Class.forName("org.postgresql.Driver");
			con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres", "postgres", "admin");
		} catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		} catch (SQLException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
		return con;
	}

	now we write
	Connection con = DBConnection.getConnection();

	I had this thought earlier but it feels like Mohammad is giving us superpowers.
	And it's a really nice feeling.

	use case:
	how can a customer change password without downloading java?
	we should be able to change the password and other details without changing our code.
	Externalize the properties in a file.

	properties file

	go to a drive and create notepad file
	username=postgres
	password=root
	driver=org.postgresql.Driver
	url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres

	saves as "revaturedb.properties"

	then we read it from eclipse
	try {
		FileReader rdr = new FileReader("revaturedb.properties");
		Properties properties = new Properties();
		properties.load(rdr);
		String driver = properties.getProperty("driver");
		String url = properties.getProperty("url");
		String username = properties.getProperty("username");
		String password = properties.getProperty("password");

		Class.forName(driver);
		con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);

	} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
		e.printStackTrace();
	} catch (SQLException) {
		e.printStackTrace();
	}

	Mohammad just show us how to create a properties file so that we can have username, password, driver, and url
	in external file for easy changes.

	So this is awesome and basically answers the question for password security when adding database projects
	to github. to always hide the file that includes passwords or sensitive data.
	I remember googling this while living in Mexico and feeling like I was just copying and pastying until I
	could get something to work. It's so nice to be introduced to this from a place of understanding.

	go to product-app-alstrom app

	run it and try 6.

	open pom.xml and add postgres dependency

	create package- com.training.pms.utility
	copy DBConnection.java and paste into this project's utility package

	copy revaturedb.properties and paste into this project

	got to DAOImpl and add at top-
	Connection connection = DBConnection.getConnection();


	------------------------------------------------

	copy and paste Statement and ResultSet stuff
	Statement stat = null;

	create case 6:


	Mohammad says we will be ready to go for creating skeleton for P zero, but now we have lunch.
	After an associates problem is resolved.
	Actually we will do after lunch. See you then.


</p>
<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
<p>
	I'm back and ready to keep learning.

	in DAOImpl
	copy and paste Statement state and ResultSet and while loop with res.next() into this project
	put entire thing inside one try catch block

	now you have to call the method in ProductApp.java

	case 6:
	productDAO.printAllProducts();

	Now we are able to print all products in this previous made product-app-alstrom project.
	It's very cool how this happens and things clicking together for Java and SQL through JDBC and postgres.

	hands on exercise:
	DBEAVER
	insert into product values (3,'Aroma',199,99);
	insert into product values (4,'Mouse',12,6);

	select * from product where productName like 'Mouse';

	try to search for a product by name and return

	Enter the product name : _____
	Here are the details for : _____

	copy and paste code from printAllProducts to searchByProductName

	change to stat.executeQuery("select * from product where productName like '"+productName+"'");

	create case 5:
	System.out.println("Please enter product name to search :");
	productName = scanner.next();
	productDAO.searchByProductName(productName);

	--------------------------------------------------------------
	now we are able to search by name in a database.....sweet.

	got it working in my bank app too. just need to add the bank tables in database

	enter the price (lower) : 3000
	enter the price (upper) : 5000

	SQL - "select * from product where price between" +lower+" and "+ upper

	prepared statements-

	**** IMPORTANT QC AND INTERVIEW QUESTION @ 2:51am
	difference between Statement and PreparedStatement Interfaces
			Statement interface is used for executing static SQL statements.

			PreparedStatement gives us the flexibility of specifying paramenters with the ? symbol.

			if you have static SQL use statement
			if you have parameters then you use PreparedStatement

	replace Statement stat with PreparedStatement stat

	stat = connection.prepareStatement("select * from product where productName like ? ");
	stat.setString(l, productName);
	ResultSet res = stat.executeQuery();

	--------------------------------------------------------------
	talking about the DAO
	**** DAO - data access objects

	add to ProductDAO.java interface
	public void searchProductByPrice(int lowerprice, int upperprice);

	copy code from searchProductByName

	private final SQL_QUERY
	stat = con.prepareStatement("select * from product where price between ? and ?");
	stat.setInt(1,lowerprice);
	stat.setInt(2,upperprice);

	add case 7: to search by price (lower/upper)

	case 7:
		System.out.println("Please enter product price (lower) :");
		int lowerprice = scanner.nextInt();
		System.out.println("Please enter product price (upper) :");
		int upperprice = scanner.nextInt();
		productDAO.searchProductByPrice(lowerprice,upperprice);
		break;
	------------------------------------------

	now for inserting into postgres fom maven

	we already wrote in ProductApp

	ProductDAOImpl.java
	statement = con.prepareStatement("insert into product values(?,?,?,?)");

	statement.setInt(1, product.getProductId());
	statement.setString(2, product.getProductName());
	statement.setInt(3, product.getQuantityOnHand());
	statement.setInt(4, product.getPrice());

	int rows = statement.executeUpdate();

	System.out.println(rows+" inserted successfully")

	surround in try catch block

	so dope Mohammad just showed us how to insert from Eclipse

	We are in full connected mode!!!

	Now we are checking update as well.

	It's already written in ProductApp.java

	Go to Impl

	copy and paste from add product to update product

	connection.prepareStatement("update product set productName = ?, quantityonhand = ?, price = ? where productId = ?");

	statement.setString(1, product.getProductName());
	statement.setInt(2, product.getQuantityOnHand());
	statement.setInt(3, product.getPrice());
	statement.setInt(4, product.getProductId());

	int rows = statement.executeUpdate();

	System.out.println(rows+" updated successfully")

	write in postgres first to check you are getting it right.
	copy and paste replace amounts with ?s.

	done for the day. Very happy with what we learned and feel ready to complete huge chunks of P zero.

</p>
<h3>Evening:</h3>
<p>
	And here we are in the evening. 4:54pm.
	Going to make the updates to bank app that we learned in our product app during class today and create table.
	I added the table and will see how it connects in the morning.

</p>

<h2>21/02/22</h2>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
	Starting QC now! Wish me luck.
	<br/>
	Think I did well but definitely got the answer wrong a bit.
	My questions were what is Maven?
	Where does Maven get dependencies from?
	What are scalar and aggregate functions in SQL?

	The correct answer is Scalar functions perform an operation on values returned from a query.
	Such as UCASE(), LCASE(), LENGTH(), ROUND().
	Aggregate functions calculate on a set of values and return a single value.
	Some examples are: AVG(), COUNT(), MIN(), MAX(), SUM().

	Here are some questions for other people:
	What is difference between WHERE and HAVING?
	What is POM.xml used for?
	What are some SQL datatypes?
	Define method overloading and method overriding?
	What is a wrapper class?
	What is SQL and why is it important for us as developers?
	What is a schema?

	(name removed) does a good job of creating a story when answering.
	Something to use when knowing the answer.
	What is a transaction?
	What properties must a transaction follow?
	What are generics?
	Write an example of generics.
	Can you tell me the difference between a List and a Set?
	What is a map in Java?
	Difference between ALTER and UPDATE commands?
	What is a JOIN?

	<br/>
	<br/>
	THE ART OF THE ANSWER:
	Answer with correct answer AND give GREAT example personal to my RECENT experience.
	The correct answer alone does not prove I know the answer.

	DONT: Say I think, UMM, I believe, that's my best guess, I'm not sure, I don't know.
	Even if you don't know, no one cares. Respond like you know and you have a chance of being right.
	Humility does not matter in an interview they are making an investment on you and your ability.

	<br/>
	I'm going to do better on the next QC or project presentation. I know how to do better.
	<br/>
	It's been taking a while for this QC. Started at 7am my time and now it's 11:31.
	Not sure if that's a bad sign, but I hope my fellow classmates are safe and our teacher too.
	The topics we've went over take a lot of repition and hands on experience.
	Let's see what happens but the anticipation is killing me.

</p>
<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
<p>
	We are going to start the day after QC with a coding challenge.
	Coding challenge was pretty easy.

	Now we are learning JDBC so we have it for building out projects.
	Java Database Connectivity
	Connects Java to SQL/Database
	GUI and CUI to DB

	to have the proper drivers for postgres to talk with JAVA you to-
	Class.forName("org.postgresql.Driver");

	throw an exception for it

	Very cool that all we have to do is add the dependency code to the pom.xml file and poof.
	It's connected. Next I assume we go to DBeaver and connect from there.
	This stuff is dope.
	<a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.postgresql/postgresql/42.3.3">JDBC Driver</a>
	and some documentation fun-
	<a href="https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/80/connect.html">JDBC Docs</a>

	also I am trying to fit in the HTC (how to code) course in the
	free time that doesn't exist. I know it creates good practices.
	<a href="https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:UBCx+HtC1x+2T2017/home">HTC Simple Data</a>

	Overloading is process by which we have same method name and different parameters.

	What is difference between abstract class and interface?

	Maven gets dependencies from.

	What is driver?
	What is types of driver?

	Going to take a breather after this class and get back in later on to update my learning app.

	I think I mainly feel there are so many individual things to memorize for QCs that I don't get a strong handle on what is asked.
	As Mohammad said.. instead of trying to memorize things word for word I'm going to take the most
	important points and know them in and out entirely. The core fundamentals.
	When he brought up the question about differencies between abstract class and interface
	it leaves me somewhat unsure... like I could answer the memorized answer when it was asked
	3 weeks ago, but now I just know an interface allows for multiple inheritance and
	abstract classes must have their methods implemented by child classes.. is that right?
	After looking <a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/difference-between-abstract-class-and-interface">here</a> I think the correct answer is-
	Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
	Interface can only have abstract methods.
	Interface supports multiple inheritance and abstract classes do not.
	Abstract class can implement an interface but interface cant implement an abstract class.
	Interface can only extend another interface.
	Maybe I do the definition with workable examples as I talked about before.

	Okay that's enough! See you later.

<h3>Evening:</h3>
<p>
</p>

<div id="Diary">
	<span class="name">Diary</span> section.
</div>
<!-- POST Diary entries below -->

<h2>20/02/22</h2>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>It's 5:35am on a Sunday and I need to memorize 100 ideas from the last week.
	I need to break it into smaller fun chunks of information.
	My imagination has to take over to make this work.
	Let's see what I have available.
</p>
<p>
	I had this idea for a video game style learning adventure.
	It would probably translate well to VR. Immersive walk through experience.
	Like you enter your memory area a place special to you. A place you know.
	And then the game develops ideas based on what you need to learn and in the
	best way for you to learn. Some ideas are people and groups of people with
	personalities, some ideas are buildings or homes, some are objects,
	some are billboards, some are a videogame within a videogame, it's endless.
	Where is your infinite well of knowledge and how can it be made visual?
	I'm a visual learner so it's a necessity for me.
	Track where it is in your brain based on your interactions.
	Instead of feeling like you are being quizzed it's like walking up to someone
	and trying to remember their name. A different type of pressure.
	Can I start now? How best to do so? Just to start I suppose.
	It starts in eclipse.

	I've built out the learning project similar to our banking app example.
	I want it to feel and work great, but I don't know how to think about doing it.
	And I worry that just by starting I'm going to make mistakes that would save me headaches in the future.
	I think at this stage of my learning this is inevitable and I just have to continue.
	So anyways I've made a App class that creats a LearnApp object to call the startLearnApp method.
	This keeps App.java as basic as possible and opens from my custom class of LearnApp.java.
	I then created a Learn.java class that I will use as my model.
	<br/> Honestly doing this is freightening.
	<br/>
	The amount of mistakes I can make is infinite, but this is better than index cards in my mind.
	So it's worth testing.
	Looking at the BankDAO.java class I can add methods to this app in a LearnDAO.java for:
	public void addMemoryItem(Learn item);
	public void updateMemoryItem(Learn item);
	public void deleteMemoryItem(int memoryId);
	public void searchByMemoryId(int memoryId);
	public void searchByMemoryName(String memoryName);
	public void printAllMemoryItems();
	<br/> but I'm going to save this for later. I just want to fill this with information that I need now.
	I ended up just building out LearnDAO.java and LearnDAOImpl.java because it was too easy not to.
	Now I am faced with buildng a new object for each memory area or doing it all in LearnApp.java...
	My gut tells me to do a new class for each area. Let me try that and see how it goes.
	<br/>
	I'm back at the desk after family woke up.
	Debating on attending an OSSU cohort that meets in 4 minutes. I dont want to take on anything that
	distracts me, but maybe it could be fresh? Idk. Couldnt hurt to try 1 and see how it goes.
	I've tried before in the past but didn't feel it pulling me along like I needed.
	<br/>
	Just went on a long Maven run with creating a learning-app project and injesting all the data
	into it. I now have a project I can build dynamically week after week.
	I kind of suprised myself a bit with this one and am happy with the outcome.
	I can add it to github so I can study from my other computer as well.

<h2>18/02/22</h2>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p> Downloaded atom on this windows so I can diary my thoughts a bit better.
	I've been trying to keep notes but theyve been a bit bare. Let's see if this helps.
	Most of what we are learning right now is to build our bank app.
	Which is project 0 in this training course.
	We are using SQL Shell for postgresql alongside with DBeaver to show how
	running multiple threads can cause a lock up.
	We just looked at savepoints between updates and inserts so that we can
	rollback to specific points. This is new for me.
	<br/>

	To study:
	4 levels of isolation we can select for RDBMS-
	<br/>
	Serializable
	<br/>
	Repeatable Reads
	<br/>
	Read Committed
	<br/>
	Read Uncommitted
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Now we are done talking about transactions.
	On to DDL: Truncate, create, alter, drop.
	Now we are learning about creating a table and inserting items.
	It's cool because we are able to check in the SQL Shell as we do so.
	We just used primary key, unique, and check to create constraints for the
	items we are adding to table.
	The DBeaver was doing some weird things when trying to create and drop
	tables with the Auto-Commit disabled for Manual Committ (Read Committed).
	This is something to be aware of when building out tables for Bank project.
	On to our first 20 minute break. Good day so far.
	Having music on in the background makes a huge difference for me.
	I've disabled spell check and trying to remove the autocomplete without making it
	a hassle to write inside here.
	Back to listening to Mohammad.
	Now we are learning about auto incrementing for primary key into table.
	Using serial, sequence.
	Sequence is nice because you can modify the start and increment amount.
	<br/>
	Feeling pretty good about this table stuff.
	I'm having some fun with it by using my Philadelphia friend's names.
	I need to do that more often to get comfortable.
	Now we are on to Normalization-

	Helps us to break the table into different parts

	We are moving to foreign keys because he cant find document pertaining to normalization.
	When the primary key of one table is available in another as a non primary key column-> foreign key.
	Foreign key is very easy to understand. Sort of like a door from one table
	to another.

	I feel like we get way too much time to do the examples. We could do twice as many.
	Why not give us the proposed example as well as an advanced example for those
	of us moving a bit faster? I find myself either trying to find examples
	online or my mind wandering a bit at leaset 25% of the class.

	on delete cascade is used for a child table to delete all referenced
	instances when using delete from students where studentId = 211;
	^my specific example.

	Next QC is on Monday from 10am - 12pm EST.

	Week 2:
	Maven
	Git
	Wrapper Classes
	Abstract
	Interfaces
	StringBuilder String Buffer
	Overloading

	CollectionAPI
	Unit Testing
	JUnit

	Week 3:
	Postgres
	2/16 all but normalization
	2/17 no JDBC
	nothing on 2/18
	referential integrity
	constraints
	data types
	TCL
	<br/>
	Mohammad updated the curriculum found here: <a href="https://app.revature.com/curriculum/12767/batch/1211/viewCalendar">HERE</a>
	<br/>
	After break we will cover rest of topics and prepare for QC.

	SQL Quiz questions

	QC questions Mohammad will share with us.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Possible QC QuestionS:

	What is referential integrity?

	<br/>
	<br/>
	ALTER TABLE statements to add, drop,

	Alter makes changes to table structure
	Update makes changes to values/data

	On to Set Operators

	Union

	Union All

	Intersect returns the same items from each table

	Except/Minus returns distinct rows selected by 1st query not present in 2nd query.

	Have all the QC resources from Mohammad saved to -> C:\Users\Winterfam\Desktop\Revature\QC_PREPARE\QC_Week2_Week3

	Im using GIT on here to push to my github repo. I like the public nature
	of what I am doing being open to anyone, anytime.

	Back from another 20 minute break that I spent at my computer.
	<br/>
	Back to normalization-
		to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.
		and we are done for the day. I'll be back to prepare notes / index cards
		for the QC
