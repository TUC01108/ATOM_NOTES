<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p> Downloaded atom on this windows so I can diary my thoughts a bit better.
	I've been trying to keep notes but theyve been a bit bare. Let's see if this helps.
	Most of what we are learning right now is to build our bank app.
	Which is project 0 in this training course.
	We are using SQL Shell for postgresql alongside with DBeaver to show how
	running multiple threads can cause a lock up.
	We just looked at savepoints between updates and inserts so that we can
	rollback to specific points. This is new for me.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	To study:
	4 levels of isolation we can select for RDBMS-
	<br/>
	Serializable
	<br/>
	Repeatable Reads
	<br/>
	Read Committed
	<br/>
	Read Uncommitted
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Now we are done talking about transactions.
	On to DDL: Truncate, create, alter, drop.
	Now we are learning about creating a table and inserting items.
	It's cool because we are able to check in the SQL Shell as we do so.
	We just used primary key, unique, and check to create constraints for the
	items we are adding to table.
	The DBeaver was doing some weird things when trying to create and drop
	tables with the Auto-Commit disabled for Manual Committ (Read Committed).
	This is something to be aware of when building out tables for Bank project.
	On to our first 20 minute break. Good day so far.
	Having music on in the background makes a huge difference for me.
	I've disabled spell check and trying to remove the autocomplete without making it
	a hassle to write inside here.
	Back to listening to Mohammad.
	Now we are learning about auto incrementing for primary key into table.
	Using serial, sequence.
	Sequence is nice because you can modify the start and increment amount.
	<br/>
	Feeling pretty good about this table stuff.
	I'm having some fun with it by using my Philadelphia friend's names.
	I need to do that more often to get comfortable.
	Now we are on to Normalization-

	Helps us to break the table into different parts

	We are moving to foreign keys because he cant find document pertaining to normalization.
	When the primary key of one table is available in another as a non primary key column-> foreign key.
	Foreign key is very easy to understand. Sort of like a door from one table
	to another.

	I feel like we get way too much time to do the examples. We could do twice as many.
	Why not give us the proposed example as well as an advanced example for those
	of us moving a bit faster? I find myself either trying to find examples
	online or my mind wandering a bit at leaset 25% of the class.

	on delete cascade is used for a child table to delete all referenced
	instances when using delete from students where studentId = 211;
	^my specific example.

	Next QC is on Monday from 10am - 12pm EST.

	Week 2:
	Maven
	Git
	Wrapper Classes
	Abstract
	Interfaces
	StringBuilder String Buffer
	Overloading

	CollectionAPI
	Unit Testing
	JUnit

	Week 3:
	Postgres
	2/16 all but normalization
	2/17 no JDBC
	nothing on 2/18
	referential integrity
	constraints
	data types
	TCL
	<br/>
	Mohammad updated the curriculum found here: <a href="https://app.revature.com/curriculum/12767/batch/1211/viewCalendar">HERE</a>
	<br/>
	After break we will cover rest of topics and prepare for QC.

	SQL Quiz questions

	QC questions Mohammad will share with us.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Possible QC QuestionS:

	What is referential integrity?

	<br/>
	<br/>
	ALTER TABLE statements to add, drop,

	Alter makes changes to table structure
	Update makes changes to values/data

	On to Set Operators

	Union

	Union All

	Intersect returns the same items from each table

	Except/Minus returns distinct rows selected by 1st query not present in 2nd query.

	Have all the QC resources from Mohammad saved to -> C:\Users\Winterfam\Desktop\Revature\QC_PREPARE\QC_Week2_Week3

	Im using GIT on here to push to my github repo. I like the public nature
	of what I am doing being open to anyone, anytime.

	Back from another 20 minute break that I spent at my computer.
	<br/>
	Back to normalization-
		to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.
		and we are done for the day. I'll be back to prepare notes / index cards
		for the QC
