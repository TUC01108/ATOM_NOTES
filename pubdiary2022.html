<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p> Downloaded atom on this windows so I can diary my thoughts a bit better.
	I've been trying to keep notes but theyve been a bit bare. Let's see if this helps.
	Most of what we are learning right now is to build our bank app.
	Which is project 0 in this training course.
	We are using SQL Shell for postgresql alongside with DBeaver to show how
	running multiple threads can cause a lock up.
	We just looked at savepoints between updates and inserts so that we can
	rollback to specific points. This is new for me.

	<br/>
	To study:
	4 levels of isolation we can select for RDBMS-
	<br/>
	Serializable
	<br/>
	Repeatable Reads
	<br/>
	Read Committed
	<br/>
	Read Uncommitted
	<br/>
