	Like what will I use most frequently and how to reference them
	quickly until they are embedded in my brain.
	For example-
	RequestDispatcher
	seems very useful when building webpages using JSPs and Java.
	Think on this a bit.

	 ###########################################
	 <h2>07/03/22</h2>
	<h3>Evening:</h3>
	<p>
	I'm back for a minute to see if there's anything to sort out
	with the project. I'm upstairs so a bit limited but can still
	make some progress.

	I'm in a position where I can really plan this out effectively.
	Like we have a LoginDAO interface for everything related to
	login. For now that is register and validate/login.
	I use the users table for this at the moment.
	Is there a reason to use a login table like I did before?
	What does that achieve?
	I'll chew on that. It's nice to pass through the user object
	instead of all the variables like I did before.
	Cleaner this way.

	And O wakes up.
	</p>
	<p>
	Back again. 7:52p.


	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
	<p>
	Back!
	Now we are seeing how to use the values passing through.

	DBEAVER
	create table:
	userid - serial
	validateUser - boolean

	we are covering login and logout

	create table user (
		userId serial,
		username varchar(20),
		password varchar(20),
		gender varchar(10),
		notifications varchar(20),
		qualification varchar(20)
	)

	2:00pm on recording

	create a model class that matches the table created
	right click>new class>com.training.ers.model
	User
		private int userId;
		private String username;
		private String password;
		private String gender;
		private String notifications;
		private String qualification;

	generate default constructor, constructor with fields,
	getters and setters, hashcode and equals, toString

	in SignUpController.java servlet

	String finalNotification = "";
	for(String temp:notification) {
		finalNotification += temp +":";
	}
	User user = new User(-1, username, password, gender,
	finalNotification, qualification);

	out.println("You are registered successfully and your password
	is : "+password);

	moved the String finalNotification; to the instance level.
	</p>
	<p>
	---------
	So we now can do array returns as values from user input.
	We are about to enter into Database.

	go to banking app loginDAO
	copy utility and dao packages
	paste into P1
	copy and paste mydb.properties from previous project
	paste into project
	copy and paste dependencies
	postgresql

	refactor name com.training.ers.dao
	only need LoginDAO and LoginDAOImpl

	change LoginDAO
		register(User user)
	Change LoginDAOImpl
		register(User user)

	-------
	tufail going to go through everything again so repeating above
	1) database
	2) dao

	go to SignUpController
	// below saves in database

	LoginDAO loginDAO = new LoginDAOImpl();
	loginDAO.register(user);

	add link after successfully registered for login page
	a href="login.html" Login

	When at SignInController-
	LoginDAO loginDAO = new LoginDAOImpl();

	boolean result = loginDAO.validate(username, password);

	if(result) {
		Welcome +username
	} else {
		your username/password is incorrect , please login again.
		add hyperlink to the login text
	}

	SUCCESSFULLY got a login and signup working for new project
	with Tufail's help. This is huge step for the project.
	Thank you to him for taking time to show as figuring out on
	own would have eaten up a lot of time.
	So cool.
	We have servlets running Java code on webpage using HTML,
	JavaScript, JDBC, postgreSQL, and SQL all together in sync.
	This is smooth
	</p>
	<p>
	Back from a 20 minute break.

	got through some errors people had.
	getting*

	now through. 2:38p

	will get a view example tomorrow.

	create new html files for menus
	on signincontroller.java
	add proceed to your home page
	with a link to welcome.html

	table of reimbursement

	on welcome html page-
	please submit reimbursement details :
	FORM
	name, type, amount,
	with submit input type

	go to DBEAVER
	create table reimbursement (


	)

	Tufail has informed us th QC is not happening tomorrow. But
	I'm going to study this week and get fully ready between P1
	creation.

	This helps a ton but nxt week going to be FULL.

	This is a job and an opportunity. Treat it as such, and you'll
	get everything you can out of it.

	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<h3>Morning:</h3>
	<p>
	Back at it. Rushed morning. I'll blame on daylight saving
	time starting next sunday. My least favorite time of year
	by FAR. If I could get rid of that construct I would.
	Only motivation to get into politics.

	1:1 with Mohammad. He will ask us questions in prep for QC.
	For this week:
	DevOps
	AWS-
	RDS
	Bucket
	Logging
	Lambdas
	Next week- Angular

	We will cover servlets and JSP.
	servlet-
		server side code
		request and response
			create compile and deploy
			tomcat- deploys
	example- maven project that uses servlets to print hello world
	file new>maven project>webapp>com.training - servlets-demo
	build path>configure build path 1.8
	buiild path>configure build path

	Had to create a new server by
	right click in servers>new server
	and then changing build path and running on new server.

	how to create a servlet-
	(server side program)
	right click>new>other>servlet
	java packages- com.training.controller
	class name- WelcomeController
	next
	add- /welcome url mappings
	next
	no changes
	Finish

	change doGet()
	<!--
		PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
		response.setContentType("text/html");

		out.println("<html>");
		out.println<body bgcolor=pink>");
		out.println("<h1>Hello and welcome to my website</h1>");
		out.println("</body></html>");
	-->
	</p>
	<p>
	That's really cool. Running code through servlets.
	This reminds me of something with Django.

	I'm trying to think of ways this is useful.
	While learning it's hard to absorb concepts and connect them
	with their use cases. Like idk how this is different than
	writing the javascript in html.... but maybe just having the
	power of java on a webpage is the whole point?
	webapp is where all html files are. do not create in WEB-INF.

	Why create a servlet vs html
	html is static

	looking at login.html file

	copy login.html and styles.css and paste into webapp

	add link to login to index.jsp

	copy signUp.html and paste into webapp

	apply the css in the head of index.jsp

	copy revlogo.png into webapp

	how to store password from login form

	action="SignInController"
	right click>new>servlet
	com.training.controller
	SignInController

	SignInController.java
	change doGet
	<!--
		PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
		response.setContentType("text/html");
		String uname = request.getParameter("username");
		String pwd = request.getParameter("password");

		out.println("<html>");
		out.println<body bgcolor=pink>");
		out.println("Username :"+uname);
		out.println("Your password is :")+pwd);
		out.println("</body></html>");

		-->
	restart the server to get updated changes
	right click and click clean
	right click server> add and remove

	Back from 20 minutes break.
	</p>
	<p>
	Now to use this for P1 project purposes

	winter-ers-project
	watch at 23:15 in recording Tufail time

	kickstart for P1-
	provide name, password, gender on login

	Write welcome to my ERS with Login and Signup links
	login takes you to login page
	which takes you to ""welcome, name"

	signup takes you to page that shows all details entered
	SignUpController

	Pretty happy I figured that out with setting up login and
	signup with servlets for the project 1 on first go.
	So we are getting the information from the user input,
	which means we can store in an object or do anything with it.
	This is helpful.

	method="get" calls doGet() in servlet
	anything in doGet() will be dislayed in url

	method="post" calls doPost()

	post goes into body portion without appending in URL.

	changed both my login and signup to post instead of GET

	Going on lunch break, back at 12:15p

	Back and slept in today. Go to sleep at 9:15p to get
	back on track.

	I'm planning out my P1 even though we have our QC on Tuesday.
	I give this another 30 minutes and then move on to QC
	studying.
	I have an example setup on excalidraw to give visual
	of the structure of my program. ERS
	Expense Reimbursement System.
	I am also drawing by hand to see how similar and different
	it will be from P0. I can avoid some mistakes I ran into
	with that project.

	So the functionality of this project is very similar to the
	project we just did. Really the only difference I am seeing
	is the connectivity to the webpage so finding how Java and
	Postgresql receive and send data to javascript or
	however that is done. Also the optional requirements will
	really make it stand out so worth going through them in
	beginning before coding to see how they could change the
	structure or we could pivot minorly to allow their room
	for implementation without slowing anything down too much.
	I don't want to bite off more than I can chew, but I also
	know how it feels to "finish" early. Feel like there's
	nothing else to do WHEN clearly there was lots more to do
	and I just couldnt see it. Dont do that again.

	Just found some quizlet study decks that will be good.
	I deleted some topics off of it that we havent
	got to yet, but sharing with batch mates now.
	https://quizlet.com/_b73tp3?x=1qqt&i=477pnb

	We are back. Working with cucumber in selenium tests.
	---------------------
	QC on Tuesday. This one I am doing perfect on.
	1pm PT
	****
	Javascript
	Selenium
	Cucumber
	Gherkin
	WebDriver Setup
	POM
	PageFactoy
	HTML
	CSS
	****
	---------------------
	What is POM (Project Object Model)-
	Design pattern to create object repository
	A class is create for each page to identify..
	the web elements of that page and also can contain action.
	Seperates tets objects and test scripts.
	For reusability and readability.

	create class LoginPAge inside package com.training.pages
	in selenium-cucumber

	WebDriver driver;
	By txt_username = By.id("name");
	By txt_password = By.id("password");
	By btn_login = By.id("login");
	By btn_logout = By.id("logout");

	create default constructor-
	public LoginPage(WebDriver driver)
		{
		this.driver = driver;
		}

	public void enterUsername(String username) {
		driver.findElement(txt_username).sendKeys(username);
	}
	public void enterPassword(String password) {
		driver.findElement(txt_password).sendKeys(password);
	}
	public void clickLogin() {
		driver.findElement(btn_login).click();
	}
	public boolean checkLogoutDisplayed() {
		driver.findElement(btn_logout)isDisplayed();
	}
	public boolean checkLoginDisplayed() {
		driver.findElement(btn_login)isDisplayed();
	}

	PAGE OBJECT MODEL
	available in Maven

	PageFactory
	-A simple and easier implementation of POM in selenium
	Selenium inbuilt POM
	@FindBy

	initElements

	Now we are on to tags after a 20 minute break.
	</p>
	<p>
	They can be custom like
	@googletest
	@testproject
	@logintest

	in the TestRunner.java file you add a ,
	after the @cucumberOptions plugin {}
	and add the @ symbol for tests you want to run.

	My computer is overheating and zoom isnt responding going
	to restart eclipse first then zoom if needed.

	This concludes selenium and cucumber for now.

	done class. will be on later.

	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<h3>Morning:</h3>
	<p>
	Starting now!

	Back into cucumber

	Got my cucumber test running for the saucedemo.
	Something about this is very cool.

	Back from a 20 minutes break.

	</p>
	<p>
	So we are learning a lot of testing. This could be
	what I will be doing for foreseeable future.
	Find lasting ways to learn and remember
	everything important.

	Hot to generate test reports in different formats.
	Don't just try to understand for right now.
	How to quickly navigate to these answers when
	I need them.

	Some things I will learn by brute force repition.
	Some things are more specific to situations.
	File resources as such. Scenario based.

	I guess this training is sort of like a fire-hose
	of information and just trying my best to figure
	out on the fly what is going to be the most
	important things we are experiencing, but the
	biggest part is just surviving and trusting their
	system to mold me into the full stack software
	developer they aim for me to become. I did not
	start this process because I knew how to do that
	myself.. it was the complete opposite.
	I've tried and know I give up that control and
	put in 100% of my effort where this company deems
	it best to do so.

	Reports generated as HTML, JSON, and XML

	Parameterized or data driven testing-
	use "Scenario Outline:" in .feature file
	adding diamond brackets around parameters

	Going on lunch now.

	<h3>Evening:</h3>

	<p>

	</p>
	<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
	<p>
	I'm back from lunch. Forgot to push the diary before I went on break. Feeling good about the project.
	What do I fix next?
	Let's run some tests-
	Getting my feet wet with this. Think I have the register test working... somewhat at least.

	Okay nevermind not working as needed. Having trouble testing the register as it actually registers
	a user. And then when I try to bring over the delete user method from employeeDAOImpl it doesn't
	work the way Id expect. I'm sure it's something easy I'm not seeing.

	Went down a rabbit hole with adding Tufail's procedure that supplies the updated balances for sender
	and receiver from database. Got it working.

	The tests weren't so easy so that's what I'll smooth out between now and tomorrow morning.

	Training is done for the day. Feel good about it. could have been more productive but also got a lot of
	little things done as I figured out what was needed.


	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<h3>Morning:</h3>
	<p>
	Good morning. the orange seeds have not sprouted yet, but I know they will.
	</p>
	<p>
	What are the things I still need to do:
	</p>
	<p>
	1) As an employee I am alerted how many new account applications there are.
	AND then I can approve or deny each one.
	</p>
	<p>
	2) As employee I can view all account froms a customer.
	</p>
	<p>
	3) Change the view balance option to let user select which account of theirs to view.
	</p>
	<p>
	4) Chance the make withdraw or deposit to let user select which account of theirs to use
	</p>
	<p>
	5) REFUSE withdrawing or depositing a negative amount.
	</p>
	<p>
	I'm going to start with completing the approveApply and deleteApply methods in EmployeeDAOImpl.
	approve will take the values of the apply table and insert applicable values into customers table.
	delete will delete the values from the apply table.
	</p>
	<p>
	Reject application is working great. Next will be the approve function.
	Feel like Im getting a better and better grasp on all of this and how everything works together.
	I get into moments of having no idea but get out of those moments faster and faster.

	</p>
	<p>

	Class is starting now.
	Tufail is showing us how to get the updated balances from a debit and credit transfer in dbeaver.
	transferAmountAndGetBalance(?,?,?,?,?)
	stat.execute()
	</p>
	<p>
	Now we are going over the specifications again.
	Tufail says one account per customer
	change congrats your account opened to
	congrats your account got opened and is pending approval.
	wont be able to sign in just yet. change login table to happening with approveApply method
	login will check the login table first for username and password and then the apply table.
	</p>
	<p>
	menu for approve/deny
	</p>
	<p>
	1.view all pending approval
	list of pending approvals
	press the number to aprove or deny
	Y/N (Y to approve and N to deny)
	Y
	_____ account successfully opened
	N
	______ account not approved.

	Tufail wants a status column
	default is N
	change to Y when approved by employee
	</p>
	<p>
	--------------------------------------------
	</p>
	<p>
	Trying to think of what the benefits vs negatives are of having that column with N or Y vs diff table.
	Benefit of apply table is that I can print easily.... is this true?
	Negative is that I have to do 2 seperate queries for checking if they arent in the customers table.
	Going to repost from above what I still have to do-
	</p>
	<p>
	1) As an employee I am alerted how many new account applications there are.
	AND then I can approve or deny each one.
	</p>
	<p>
	2) As employee I can view all account froms a customer.
	</p>
	<p>
	3) Change the view balance option to let user select which account of theirs to view.
	</p>
	<p>
	4) Chance the make withdraw or deposit to let user select which account of theirs to use
	</p>
	<p>
	5) REFUSE withdrawing or depositing a negative amount.

	I'm going to go with Tufail's idea and drop the extra table.

	So I've changed create user and login to reflect the updated customers table.
	Now to update the approval process.

	So now the approve and reject functions are working on a basic level.
	Have to fix so that the employee doesn't accidentally delete a different user than one he intends to.
	but that can come later.

	So now I am done with 1) shown above.
	AND 2)
	and 3)
	and 4)

	think it's just # 5 from the above options.. I need to re evaluate with these new changes and see
	what I broke in the update process.

	Looks like everything is working so far. I'll write a few JUnit tests to be sure.
	Then I'll see what this Log4j is all about. Feel like its going to be super simple read and write to file
	on local system.

	maybe i need to add functionality to customer account to ACCEPT a transaction from another account
	but based on tufails go over of the details I don't think this is required.

	I took a look at log4j, think I can get it up and running with a tutorial or two and 3-4 hours.

	Let's hold off on log4j for a bit. It's to be done when everything else is locked.
	What is next?

	refuse the negative amount withdraw or deposit.

	Okay that is fixed now too.... I'm just moving through this faster than I thought I would.

	<h2>27/02/22</h2>
	<h3>Evening:</h3>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
	<p>
	 1:11p
	 Back after putting O to nap.
	 Let's setup real boundaries for sending a transfer.

	 Cleaned up the DAOs. Getting better idea of how each actually works.
	 A lot of grabbing from the product app actually creates more confusion when you are trying to debug.
	 But it definitely helped to guide me along. Okay back to fixing those transfer to account issues.
	 Fixed!

	 Okay what next??

	 I might switch things around a bit. From reading this again I'm thinking that once a user signs
	 into the customer menu they should have an option for applying for an account.
	 Which means that they would apply and then have to wait for an employee to approve.

	 This means that I must remove the unique constraint to the username in customers table.

	 It also means the apply for account will send values to a Staging area until APPROVED by employee.
	 Which will then move it to the official customers table.

	 So with creating multiple accounts for users we need to differentiate the rows by userid for same username
	 then we can populate for employee by username.
	 And when making transfer or withdraw or deposit we have to use the userid.
	 Think this makes sense.

	 Okay so the apply table worked for sending an account application in.
	 Now I need to go through an an employee and have the system tell me if there are any pending applications.
	 If yes then I can accept or delete them.

	 Finished the view balance requirement real quick.
	 To make it work for other accounts under same username I will have to show other userid's that match username.
	 I'm a bit worried now that other people can register with the same username... but I don't think its possible.
	 As long as I make the create account process protect from this then I don't have to worry about
	 protecting at the database level.
	 Just checked... looks safe unless someone really wanted to attack this.

	 Now to do the employee side of accepting an account application.

	 So I AM READY FOR A BREAK.

	 Basically got the approve or reject function working just have to add the final detail to the employeeDAOImpl
	 so that I write out for it to approve or deny... which sounds like I did nothing . but not true.

	 Things are moving fast!




	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<h3>Morning:</h3>
	<p>
	5:31a and ready. Let's put some work in.
	And now its 6:01a and havent done anything... why!

	I've changed the loginDAO functions over to customer dao. lets see if they work.
	Works! Create acconnt, login to customer or employeee, Withdraw, deposit, and transfer work great.
	Next:
	maybe I should change balance from int to something that handles larger numbers?
	So I changed them to long.
	I need to remmeber how much time and energy it takes to do small things that pop up.
	They can kill me when I have a deadline. Which I do.
	Let's prioritize.

	Let's do the transaction table real quick. 7:32am - 20 minutes estimate

	Okay transaction table is working. I was pretty spot on with guessing time it would take. Maybe
	a little ambitious. Will add 5 minutes on estimate from here on. 7:57a

	I need to create function for employee to view all transactions.. Should basically be a copy
	of the print all products from the product alstrom app we worked on. Going to say good morning to the
	family first.

	Back at the computer. 9:14a.
	Family is good. They are going to the beach. Feel like I could join, but want to be sure I have this
	project ready to go. Don't want to guess on it. The priority is my family and through successfully
	getting a software engineering job I will fulfill the security aspect of providing how I can.

	So I have the transacations posting from withdraw, deposit, and transfer to the transaction table.
	Now I need to have the ability for employee to see all transactions. Basically the whole table.

	I have the see all transactions in the employee side working. That was easier than I thought it would be.
	Although it does something funky where in nulls the sender instead of the receiver which I thought
	would be the opposite... but still works!

	Now on my list what I have left:

	CUSTOMER-
	view the balance of a specific account
	accept a money transfer from another account

	EMPLOYEE-
	Approve or reject an account
	View a customer bank accounts

	1 JUnit test

	So the program is a mess right now.
	I was tring to figure out the delete user function.
	Which led me to attempting to print all users.
	Going to work backwards from there to see whats wrong.

	I have no idea. Im restarting eclipse.

	So restarting it and deleting the test class fixed it. Maybe it overloaded with requests to SQL
	and needed to clear itself out.. who knows.

	So I needed to add the con = DBConnection.getConnection(); to each transaction method because I had
	left the connection open previously but must have run out of whatever the limit was.

	something to add to list. The transaction goes through no matter what even if recipient doesnt exist.

	Okay taking a break. Got a lot done so far.




	</p>
	<p>

	</p>

<h2>26/02/22</h2>
<h3>Evening:</h3>
<p>
5:30p and I haven't dont much that I wanted to.
Got the windows activation fixed on my mac which is nice.
But thats more of a nice to have then need to have.
Now lets do some work.
What needs to be fixed? Going to push to git now. Just because.

Okay Im running in circles here but learning at the same time.
I realized I need to return the object from the method to have the database values stored in object.
But now Im wondering if the boolean was more important... feels stupid to ask because I can handle
easily to determine in the BankApp.java if the object was returned with nulls... but that's not the
point of a validate method. So how to have a validate method ONLY validate and run a get values from
database method that runs after its confirmed as valid... not sure if this is best but I'm going with it.


Now I'm really moving. Just moved the getting values from database into object functionality into a
method from the customerDAO rather than the LoginDAO. More of preference than anything but Im
understanding this more and more as I go along.
So it works!
I am now able to login, register, transfer funds, deposit to another specific account, withdraw,
adding deposit to account now.

I'm feeling 10,000% better than when I started an hour ago. The app is really working.
I need to add conditions all over the place. But the skeleton is holding itself up.
I'm not 100% sure on the tables just yet.
I think the login table will be strictly for gathering all users who can log in's username and password.
Maybe the customer_id and employee_id if it makes sense, but that's not clear to me.
If it has the username and password then that will be enough for now.
Then the customer table has userid, firstname, username, password, balance, accounttype.
Not even sure if accounttype really matters to be stored.
The employee table could be the same... does it need a balance? Maybe the same without a balance and accounttype
as that is more obvious... well it's obvious for both but I can use that value for further validation
possibly.

So I'm am flying through this. Crazy how many tangles you have to clean up as you figure one thing out.
I have the create customer and create employee working well. Once a customer or employee is successfully
registered they are inside the database.

Okay it's piecing together more and more. I see that I am building out the employee side of this.
I'll also need the table to log all transactions so an employee can view when they want to.

OK i am ready to leave it there. Tomorrow I do more:
I need to move the withdrawFromAccount and transferFromAccount over to the CustomerDAO.
Create the Employee functionality.
Create the transactions table.
WOOOOOOO!

<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>In the seat. Can work until 9am then have a workshop to attend.

Reminder. 2/17 n and 2/16 a

on 2/16 3:26 mark / 11:56 tufails time is how to import tables into postgres.

Jumping into project now. Hope to resolve where I left off.

I'm going to stop down on coding to think this through logically.
I'm worried that I can barrel through and create a working app despite
choosing bad practices. How do I know what is better?
I am learning what I don't know by just continuing on.
Is the point to learn as I hit these moments and keep reevaluating rather than
get into a state of paralysis? Maybe I can meet somewhere half way..
Like keep going. Stop and think for 30 minutes on what I am doing.
Then continue. Is this artificial reflection just to reduce doubt?
Is it even necessary?
Is the whole point just to create a working app no matter what?
Deciding on best practices without having experience to know better might be foolish.
Maybe its a bad practice to even worry about it.
Despite all of this. I know that I must learn how to create an instance of an object,
store the user input into its values to go to postgres database. Locate the full row
of values. Store ALL of the values in the object and return that object back to
java through jdbc. Right now I can do validation and insertion.. how to take?
</p>
<p>
What specifically am I trying to solve now?
</p>
<p>
^This is more important than any of the BS above it. Where am I know?
So a user can "login" which means the username and password they enter is validated as matching
the username and password combo stored in the database. As long as that username
variable stays as it is then we can identify someone as logged in.
We can then use that username to: view the balance of a specific account,
make transactions only from that account that is logged in to specific accounts,
withdraw from only that account,
deposit to only that account,
and accept a money transfer from another account.
This will define a customer account.

Once I complete all of the above then I move on to employee accounts-
approve or reject an account,
view any customers bank account,
view a log of all transactions.

Add a JUnit test

If I finish all of the above I will be happy.
Optional:
Log4j is implemented to log events to a file.

Okay enough thinking. I'll do the workshop and come back to this asap.

	with database to save stored values. Okay so I can at least put my
	issue into words now. I don't understand how to store the userid from

	login.setUserId because it is of default value... what am I missing
	here? Will dive in tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>I'm not sure if it's better in this order, but working so far.
	Have a late start today. Olava didn't sleep at all and kept us up. I'll

<p>I'm pulling this into eclipse and seeing if it makes more sense
	rather than having two IDEs.... but as I'm writing this I realized it
	wont work because it pushes my Eclipse over the zoom video that I use
	to watch Tufail's screen as he teaches us. So that was a quick no. Will
	stick with ATOM for note taking unless I add another monitor in here
	and can have Tufail's screen on one. My code on another and then a 3rd
	screen for browser/notes/chat. But now Im thinking I do the TV for just
	the Zoom video and my computer for the coding... Trying to think why
	this wouldnt work. Going to give it a try for a bit. I do really like
	the integration that atom has with GIT and github. Wonder if eclipse
	has it as well. In order to see updates on atom code I just have to hit
	save on eclipse. But to see it in eclipse I have to close and reopen.</p>
<p>AWS is all setup for next week. Back into JavaScript learning.

	JavaScript functions built in functions Javascript is sweet. powerful
	in a tiny punch. Can see how useful it will be with databases for user
	interfaces. We just blazed through alert(), parseInt(), confirm(),
	functions, and onclick. Tufail says to always open the console in
	browser when typing in javascript. That's how to check errors as they
	happen.</p>
<p>String methods: toLowerCase() toUpperCase() slice() charAt() I
	tested a few out with his hands on example. Math methods: sin(x) cos(x)
	tan(x) floor(x) Math.pow() Math.random()</p>
<p>Can use constructors in javascript We went on a 20 minute break.
	back now and working with javascript. Feels nice being back.</p>
Variable scope- local vs global if you don't put var before declaring
variable it can be called in other function as long as its function was

<p>Now we are in individual breakout rooms working on project zero.
	Back in driver seat. I just crunched through and got my transfer

	beautiful but I'm very happy with my progress so far. Think I've been
	leaning on my wrist too much because it feels slightly bruised. Will
	have to be conscious of this going forward. Anyways I'm excited.
	Basically I need to add: System- Reject transfers that might cause
	senders account to go below zero make sure accounts cant go below zero.
	Reject withdraw or deposit that results in negative balance Customer-
	Add a deposit to account function. View balance of a specific account

	**** javascript is for: making webpages more interactive, client side
	validations, etc. to generate html dynamically to handle html element
	events create html file for javaScript

	<!--script type="text/javascript"-->
	var name="Richard"
	<!--for(i = 1; i <= 5; i++)-->
	{
	<!--document.write("<;h1>"+name)-->
	}
	<!--document.write("<;br/>");-->
	grade=100 document.write(name + "your grade is "+grade);
	<!--<;/script>-->

	right click and inspect to check for errors official name is -
	ECMAScript back from taking a minute with Y. Now we are working on
	Pzero Will real-time update. Going to leave it here for now as I want
	to be with yordana for a few moments. Great day of learning. Best to
	remember I need to fix the withdrawal function. Something to do with
	the userid not sending through properly.

</p>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>Going to try with flipping the times of day. Think it makes more
	sense. Good morning btw. 5:19a Been working straight through to 6:27.
	Going to take a break for a moment. Got my login and customer tables
	working together so they update at same time on register. Things are
	working out. **** Reminder to finish the coding quiz before tomorrow
	evening. On revaturepro. And class begins! jdbc- callable statements
	css CallableStatement used to call stored procedure Procedure is like a
	function but can return multiple values select * from product; CREATE
	OR REPLACE FUNCTION totalRecords() RETURNS integer AS $total$ declare
	total integer; BEGIN SELECT count(*) into total FROM product; RETURN
	total; END; $total$ LANGUAGE plpgsql; --call function select
	totalRecords(); ------------Procedure create or replace procedure
	transfer( sender int, receiver int, amount dec ) language plpgsql as $$
	begin --subtract from sender update accounts set balance - balance -
	amount where id = sender; == adding to receiver update accounts set
	balance = balance + amount where id = receiver; commit; end;$$ ---call
	procedure call transfer(1,2,2000); select * from accounts; Mohammad
	showed us how to create procedure in postgres Now we are learning how
	to call it in jdbc create class in jdbc_demos
	CallingProcedureFromJava.java main Scanner scanner = new
	Scanner(System.in); System.out.println("Enter the account number to
	debit the amount :"); int sender = scanner.nextInt();

	System.out.println("Enter the account number to credit the amount :");
	int reciever = scanner.nextInt(); System.out.println("Enter the ammount
	to be transfered :"); int amount = scanner.nextInt(); Connection
	connection = DBConnection.getConnection(); CallableStatement stat =
	connection.prepareCall("call transfer(?,?,?)") stat.setInt(1,sender);
	stat.setInt(2,reciever); stat.setInt(3,amount); stat.execute();

	System.out.println("Transfer done/completed"); **** WHAT IS THE USE OF
	CALLABLE STATEMENT? is an interface by which we can make a call to a
	procedure from our jdbc This is really useful too. now we are on to
	html, css, and javascript HTML hyper text markup language used for
	creating webpages markup language because it uses tags Mohammad is a
	memory Doctor the html page we created is just a page what is CSS and
	what is javascript? selector is element to be styled So far so good. I
	sort of hope we never have to dive to far into CSS, but I'm comfortable
	with the basics. Design just never feels that interesting to me. More
	into how things work and functionality. Let's see if I agree with that
	in 10 years. internal css external CSS create new file > name
	styles.css (but can be anything.css) copy and paste from internal to
	this file. write in individual .html files- <;link type="text/css"
	rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> just added background image to all
	pages on website. SQL and java are so much more interesting to me. how
	can I make this more interesting? Like making a database work is
	fascinating but making it pretty for a user isn't so thrilling. DOM is
	document object model inline css **** QC What is difference between
	Inline and Block Elements Inline is when it renders within the line
	itself span Block elements create a new line div, p, br, onto a 20
	minute break now. We are back 9:37a Cascading Style Sheets for styling
	HTML documents composed of: selectors HTML element like h3, h1, p
	declarations comprised of a property and a value surround by curly
	braces css properties border padding margin display position color
	text-align now we are creating classes in css written in style element
	with . before like .mycolor {} I just need to know how this will apply
	to our potential job to make the connection in my mind now we have a
	usecase: // doesnt seem like we are on this yet id attribute to specify
	style p#p1{ color: fuchsia; } classes are to be used exclusively with
	dot notation css selectors element id class universal attribute **** QC
	question- What are different types of css selectors element id class
	universal attribute grouping child Now on to lunch for an hour.</p>

<h2>23/02/22</h2>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
	5:47am and I'm ready to go. Last night I changed the menu option for
	banking app to reflect what Mohammad has. It doesn't make sense to
	provide options for withdrawl and deposit / transfer before someone has
	logged in. I've now switched over the variable accountName to username
	to match what I need for loggin in on BankDAO and BankDAOImpl. Now I'm
	modifying AddAccount method and checking the status of table with
	printAllAccount method. So I successfully add the add account function
	to my app, but that was for a test users table. Now I have to switch it
	over to the respective Employees and Customers tables depending on
	which they are. Class is starting now. <br /> <br /> Need to have
	clearer things to study after each day and load it into the
	learning-app. Like yesterday I took notes all day but dont have clear
	idea on what would be asked on QCs that needs to change. <br /> <br />
	**** JDBC terms and core concepts are important DAO - Data access
	Object Interfaces of JDBC **** <br /> <br /> Design Pattern Reusable
	solutions to common software development problems We use the DAO design
	pattern in our banking app to seperate the problem domain from the
	persistence mechanism. Uses interfaces to define an abstraction <br />
	<br /> We are taking some time to read about DAO Design Pattern here <a
		href="https://app.revature.com/curriculum/12767/batch/1211/viewCalendar">2/21</a>
	From my understanding it seperates the methods into an interface from
	the concrete class that accesses the database. Which allows you to
	switch out that concrete class for a different database if needed or
	whatever way you are accessing the data. <br /> <br /> Now we will
	create the delete function in project. Actually he wants to talk about
	statement and prepared statement **** QC Question! ^ <br /> <br />
	Now to delete copy and paste the update code in ProductDAOImpl "delete
	from product where productId =?") statement.setInt(1, productId); <br />
	<br /> (rows + " deleted successfully") <br /> <br /> then
	ProductApp case 2: productId = scanner.nextInt();
	productDAO.deleteProduct(productId); break; <br /> <br /> If you try
	to delete a product that isn't there you should handle that. If you try
	to update a product that isnt there you should handle at the moment
	entered. ^ create a method if product exists in ProductDAO.java public
	boolean isProductExists(int productId); <br /> <br /> copy code from
	searchProductByName to isProductExists <br /> <br /> public boolean
	isProductExists(int productId) { boolean productExists = false;
	PreparedStatement stat; try{ stat = con.prepareStatement("select * from
	product where productId = ? "); stat.setInt(1, productId); ResultSet
	res = stat.executeQuery(); productExists = res.next(); } catch
	(SQLException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } return productExists; } <br />
	<br /> now we will use JUnit testing to see if method works as we
	hope. <br /> <br /> write test case- <br /> <br /> right click on
	DAOImpl create new>Test Case configure for 1.8 <br /> <br /> he's
	going really fast through this so someone will ask him to do it again-
	<br /> <br /> ProductDAO productDAO; @Afterall <br /> <br />
	@BeforeEach void setUp() throws Exception { productDAO = new
	ProductDAOImpl(); } @Test @DisplayName("Testing product exists-1") void
	testIsProductExists() { int productID=2; boolean actual =
	productDAO.isProductExists(productId); assertTrue(actual); <br /> <br />
	@Test @DisplayName("Testing product exists-2") void
	testIsProductExists2() { int productID=2827; boolean actual =
	productDAO.isProductExists(productId); assertFalse(actual); } <br /> <br />
	@Test @DisplayName("Testing product exists-3") void
	testIsProductExists4() { int productID=20827; boolean actual =
	productDAO.isProductExists(productId); assertFalse(actual); } <br /> <br />
	That was tough to keep up with but I got through and can replicate for
	my own test cases in the bank app. Adding that now and will do delete
	if there's extra time. <br /> <br /> we cant test a method that is
	void. (i think) so we are changing our methods to return something.
	public boolean addProduct public boolean updateProduct public Product
	searchByProductId public List<;Product> searchByProductName public
	List<;Product> searchProductByPrice public List<;Product>
	getProducts(); (without semi colons above) public boolean
	isProductExists <br /> <br /> change for each in ProductDAOImpl
	initialize row=0 take away initialization at int rows =
	statement.executeUpdate(); <br /> <br /> if(rows==0) return false;
	else return true; <br /> <br /> he is adding them to codeshare for
	us-
	<ahref"https://codeshare.io/tufail">here</a> <br />
	<br />
	he is changing the searchByProductName code <br />
	<br />
	List<;Product> products = new ArrayList<;Product>(); PreparedStatement
	stat' try{ stat = connection.prepareStatement("select * from product
	where productName like ? ") stat.setString(1, productName); <br />
	<br />
	ResultSet res = stat.executeQuery(); while(res.next()) { Product
	product = new Product(); product.setProductId(res.getInt(1));
	product.setProductName(res.getString(2));
	product.setQuantityOnHand(res.getInt(3));
	product.setPrice(res.getInt(4)); products.add(product); } } catch
	(SQLException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } return products <br />
	<br />
	now we change printAllProducts to public void getProducts() { } <br />
	<br />
	change getProducts and searchProductsByPrice <br />
	<br />
	going to 17 minute break and back at 9:35a <br />
	<br />
	back from break and mohammad is flying. <br />
	<br />
	I'm caught up now he is adding test cases for all methods- <br />
	<br />
	@TestMethodOrder(value = MethodOrderer.OrderAnnotation.class) <br />
	<br />
	ProductDAO productDAO int productId; Product product; <br />
	<br />
	@BeforeEach void setUp() throws Exception { productDAO = new
	ProductDAOImpl(); productId = 9999; product = new Product(); } <br />
	<br />
	@Test @Order(value = 1) void testAddProduct() { Product product = new
	Product(productId, "Dummy", 10, 100);
	assertTrue(productDAO.addProduct(product)); } <br />
	<br />
	@Test @Order(value = 2) void testSearchByProductId() { Product
	foundProduct = productDAO.searchByProductId(productId); product = new
	Product(productId, "Dummy", 10, 100); assertEquals(foundProduct,
	product); } <br />
	<br />
	@Test @Order(value = 3) void testUpdateProduct() { Product
	updatedProduct = new Product(productId, "NewDummy", 199, 90);
	productDAO.updateProduct(updatedProduct);
	assertTrue(productDAO.updateProduct(updatedProduct)); } <br />
	<br />
	@Test @Order(value = 4) void testGetProducts() { List<;Product>
	products = productDAO.getProducts(); assertNotEquals(0,
	products.size()); } <br />
	<br />
	@Test @Order(value = 5) void testDeleteProduct() {
	assertTrue(productDAO.deleteProduct(productId)); } <br />
	<br />
	go to DAOImpl <br />
	<br />
	searchProductById <br />
	<br />
	He is adding test code and Impl code to codeshare now. <br />
	<br />
	finish updating tests we went through together and finish the final 3
	that we didn't. <br />
	<br />
</p>
<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
<p>

	Back from lunch All functions working properly and all tests. <br /> <br />
	Now we got to ProductApp.java and make sure all working there. <br />
	<br /> case 1: if(productDAO.isProductExists(productId)) {
	System.out.printlin("Product with product id : "+productId+" already
	exists, please try with another product id"); continue; } <br /> <br />
	result = productDAO.addProduct(product); if(result) {
	System.out.println("Congratulations, your product....") } else { "Sorry
	your product cannot be saved" } <br /> <br /> case 2:
	if(productDAO.isProductExists(productId)) {
	productDAO.deleteProduct(productId); "product deleted successfully"; }
	else { "product with product id : "+productId+" does not exist, hence
	it cannot be deleted." } <br /> <br /> case 3:
	if(!productDAO.isProductExists(productId)) { "product does not exist so
	could not be updated"; continue; }
	-------------------------------------------------------------- declare
	at top of ProductApp List<;Product> products = <br /> <br /> for case
	5: products = productDaO.searchByProductName(productName);
	printProductDetails(products); <br /> <br /> case 6: products =
	productDAO.getProducts(); printProductDetails(products); <br /> <br />
	case 7: <br /> <br /> products =
	productDAO.searchProductByPrice(lower,upper); <br /> <br />
	printProductDetails(products); break; <br /> <br /> outside the while
	loop and start product app <br /> <br /> public void
	printProductDetails(List<;Product> products) { Iterator<;Product>
	iterator = products.iterator(); while(iterator.hasNext()) { Product
	temp = iterator.next(); System.out.println(temp); } } <br /> <br />
	need to fix search by name to say "___ does not exist" if item does not
	exist if(products.size()==0) { System.out.println("No products matching
	your criteria"); continue; } <br /> <br /> case 4: <br /> <br />
	copy code from delete code <br /> <br /> if
	(productDAO.isProductExists(productId)) { Product temp =
	productDAO.searchByProductId(productId); System.out.println(temp); } <br />
	<br /> So I think this project is basically fully functional. <br />
	<br /> All the menu items work, all the methods work, a few test
	cases. Need to finish this. But overall it was great building from
	scratch with Mohammad. He says log4j is optional for p zero but I
	really want to have it working. My plan is to have the full project
	done on Saturday. Code locked by Sunday morning. And then practice
	presenting it on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. <br /> <br /> Mohammad
	is dropping knowledge on the project for login and validate. rewatch
	recording at 2:50am his time. 1:25p my time. <br /> <br />
	while(true) { 1. add user 2. login "please enter your choice" choice =
	scanner.nextInt(); <br /> <br /> switch } <br /> <br /> On a 20
	minute break now. Mohammad just went into super hyper drive with what
	he shared. Everything super useful for our projects. I don't feel
	worried about anything now. Just have to put in the time. <br /> <br />
	I'm jumping back in early to start taking more chunks out of this
	project. <br /> <br /> I'm hungry for it. <br /> <br /> So I got
	all the way through the Login build out to validating a user login. I
	will rewatch the video to follow that along. Really nice of him to
	provide that to us. Will not take for granted. Okay back into training.
	I'm so excited to do this on my own later. Future apologies to my wife
	and kids but this is so dope. <br /> <br /> sql and jdbc quiz- open
	for 2 days <br /> <br /> hands on for right now: <br /> <br /> if
	you choose 1: please enter username: please enter password: <br /> <br />
	congrats you are registered <br /> <br /> then return to main menu <br />
	<br /> please enter username: please enter password: <br /> <br />
	if correct- welcome, joseph <br /> <br /> product app menu <br /> <br />
	my login isnt working correctly I will have to debug later <br /> <br />
	He says to add a logout option to the menu once logged in. <br /> <br />
	We are done with class for the day. Have to work on P0 and finish the
	quiz and update learning app. <br /> <br /> tomorrow is jdbc, html,
	css, javascript.





</p>
<h3>Evening:</h3>
<p>I'm back. I wasted some time adding br's to the previous entries.
	not worth the effort. Maybe I can script something through the html?
	Anyways, I'm going to add some of the stuff Mohammad graced us with
	earlier. Going to go side by side from product-app-alstrom and get this
	working. Okay got my register user working. It was a simple mistake. I
	forgot to put login = new Login(userId, username, password); before
	passing the data to sql. My last thought before calling it a night is
	how to increment across all tables when i insert on 1. Like adding a
	login should add the info to employee and make sure customer knows the
	next available as well. Going to figure this out in the morning.</p>

<h2>22/02/22</h2>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
	5:50am- I see more clearly how to study and learn. Starting now. I'll
	go back and add the basics to my app. The core of Java and SQL and all
	other subjects we learn. Prioritize items to memorize based on what
	they are. I've been doing a blind study method that isn't working good
	enough. I added postgres dependency to pom.xml for learning-app and the
	Driver location to app.java. <br /> <br /> We are about to start this
	QC orientation. I don't know why we are doing this instead of studying
	as I feel I understand what QC's are for and how to improve at them,
	but will go in with open mind. It feels like we are already a bit
	behind covering material and yesterday we lost 4.5 hours to QC then we
	did lunch. By the time we came back we had 1.5 hours to learn. Anyways
	that's enough ranting. I'll update as it progresses. This is literally
	the same Orientation that we already sat through.... A little
	frustrating but let me see if there's anything I can learn from
	watching again. Some good tips: Watch how trainer debugs problems that
	happen. Write pseuodcode. Record yourself preparing for QC and watch
	the recording. <br /> <br /> Finished with the 2nd go at QC. It was
	actually nice to rehear some of the points again. I think if my batch
	mates are open to the suggestions they reiterated it would benefit all
	of us. Most of the answers I hear and I give sound like the average or
	poor answers and the goal is to get a job at the end of this. So I have
	a LOT of room to improve and will continue to make the effort to do so.
	<br /> <br /> Now we are in class with Mohammad. We are leaving the
	QC behind us and Mohammad will do 1:1 with each of us to communicate
	feedback. Now we are back into JDBC and preparing for everything we
	need to know for P0. Step 1: Load the appropriate driver Step 2: Create
	the connection url username password //java.sql package Connection con
	=
	DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres",
	"postgres", "admin"); //System.out.println("Connected"); add
	SQLException throws exception PRETTY SWEET WE ARE CONNECTED! Step 3:
	Statement stat = con.createStatement(); Step 4: ResultSet res =
	stat.executeQuery("select * from employees"); // takes the cursor to
	the next row // and returns false if no record is there
	while(res.next()) { System.out.println(res.getString(1)+ " ");
	System.out.println(res.getString(2)+ " ");
	System.out.print(res.getInt("salary")+ " ");
	System.out.println(res.getString("email")); } // closing the resultset,
	statement and connection res.close(); stat.close(); con.close(); //make
	sure you have imports for SQL //Do we have anyway by which we can
	retrieve the column information ResultSetMetaData rsmd =
	res.getMetaData(); int columnCount = rsmd.getColumnCount(); // printing
	the column names for (int i = 1; i<=columnCount; i++){
	System.out.print(rsmd.getColumnName(i)+" "); } System.out.println(); //
	printing all the values of the table for (int i =1; i <= columnCount;
	i++) { System.out.print(res.getString(i) + " "); }
	System.out.println(); ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ that is SWEEEEEEET 22:32p he says
	DEFINITION QC Answer for metadata We are now back from a 23 minute
	break Now we are learning about insert and update as well. Create
	another class called InsertDemo //driver //connection Instead of
	writing the driver and connection in each class we will use a method
	and call the method in .utility package DBConnection public static
	Connection getConnection() { Connection con = null; try{
	Class.forName("org.postgresql.Driver"); con =
	DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres",
	"postgres", "admin"); } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
	e.printStackTrace(); } catch (SQLException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }
	return con; } now we write Connection con =
	DBConnection.getConnection(); I had this thought earlier but it feels
	like Mohammad is giving us superpowers. And it's a really nice feeling.

	use case: how can a customer change password without downloading java?
	we should be able to change the password and other details without
	changing our code. Externalize the properties in a file. properties
	file go to a drive and create notepad file username=postgres
	password=root driver=org.postgresql.Driver
	url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres saves as
	"revaturedb.properties" then we read it from eclipse try { FileReader
	rdr = new FileReader("revaturedb.properties"); Properties properties =
	new Properties(); properties.load(rdr); String driver =
	properties.getProperty("driver"); String url =
	properties.getProperty("url"); String username =
	properties.getProperty("username"); String password =
	properties.getProperty("password"); Class.forName(driver); con =
	DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password); } catch
	(FileNotFoundException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } catch (SQLException)
	{ e.printStackTrace(); } Mohammad just show us how to create a
	properties file so that we can have username, password, driver, and url
	in external file for easy changes. So this is awesome and basically
	answers the question for password security when adding database
	projects to github. to always hide the file that includes passwords or
	sensitive data. I remember googling this while living in Mexico and
	feeling like I was just copying and pastying until I could get
	something to work. It's so nice to be introduced to this from a place
	of understanding. go to product-app-alstrom app run it and try 6. open
	pom.xml and add postgres dependency create package-
	com.training.pms.utility copy DBConnection.java and paste into this
	project's utility package copy revaturedb.properties and paste into
	this project got to DAOImpl and add at top- Connection connection =
	DBConnection.getConnection();


	------------------------------------------------ copy and paste
	Statement and ResultSet stuff Statement stat = null; create case 6:


	Mohammad says we will be ready to go for creating skeleton for P zero,
	but now we have lunch. After an associates problem is resolved.
	Actually we will do after lunch. See you then.


</p>
<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
<p>I'm back and ready to keep learning. in DAOImpl copy and paste
	Statement state and ResultSet and while loop with res.next() into this
	project put entire thing inside one try catch block now you have to
	call the method in ProductApp.java case 6:
	productDAO.printAllProducts(); Now we are able to print all products in
	this previous made product-app-alstrom project. It's very cool how this
	happens and things clicking together for Java and SQL through JDBC and
	postgres. hands on exercise: DBEAVER insert into product values
	(3,'Aroma',199,99); insert into product values (4,'Mouse',12,6); select
	* from product where productName like 'Mouse'; try to search for a
	product by name and return Enter the product name : _____ Here are the
	details for : _____ copy and paste code from printAllProducts to
	searchByProductName change to stat.executeQuery("select * from product
	where productName like '"+productName+"'"); create case 5:
	System.out.println("Please enter product name to search :");
	productName = scanner.next();
	productDAO.searchByProductName(productName);

	-------------------------------------------------------------- now we
	are able to search by name in a database.....sweet. got it working in
	my bank app too. just need to add the bank tables in database enter the
	price (lower) : 3000 enter the price (upper) : 5000 SQL - "select *
	from product where price between" +lower+" and "+ upper prepared
	statements- **** IMPORTANT QC AND INTERVIEW QUESTION @ 2:51am
	difference between Statement and PreparedStatement Interfaces Statement
	interface is used for executing static SQL statements.

	PreparedStatement gives us the flexibility of specifying paramenters
	with the ? symbol. if you have static SQL use statement if you have
	parameters then you use PreparedStatement replace Statement stat with
	PreparedStatement stat stat = connection.prepareStatement("select *
	from product where productName like ? "); stat.setString(l,
	productName); ResultSet res = stat.executeQuery();

	-------------------------------------------------------------- talking
	about the DAO **** DAO - data access objects add to ProductDAO.java
	interface public void searchProductByPrice(int lowerprice, int
	upperprice); copy code from searchProductByName private final SQL_QUERY
	stat = con.prepareStatement("select * from product where price between
	? and ?"); stat.setInt(1,lowerprice); stat.setInt(2,upperprice); add
	case 7: to search by price (lower/upper) case 7:
	System.out.println("Please enter product price (lower) :"); int
	lowerprice = scanner.nextInt(); System.out.println("Please enter
	product price (upper) :"); int upperprice = scanner.nextInt();
	productDAO.searchProductByPrice(lowerprice,upperprice); break;
	------------------------------------------ now for inserting into
	postgres fom maven we already wrote in ProductApp ProductDAOImpl.java
	statement = con.prepareStatement("insert into product
	values(?,?,?,?)"); statement.setInt(1, product.getProductId());
	statement.setString(2, product.getProductName()); statement.setInt(3,
	product.getQuantityOnHand()); statement.setInt(4, product.getPrice());

	int rows = statement.executeUpdate(); System.out.println(rows+"
	inserted successfully") surround in try catch block so dope Mohammad
	just showed us how to insert from Eclipse We are in full connected
	mode!!! Now we are checking update as well. It's already written in
	ProductApp.java Go to Impl copy and paste from add product to update
	product connection.prepareStatement("update product set productName =
	?, quantityonhand = ?, price = ? where productId = ?");

	statement.setString(1, product.getProductName()); statement.setInt(2,
	product.getQuantityOnHand()); statement.setInt(3, product.getPrice());
	statement.setInt(4, product.getProductId()); int rows =
	statement.executeUpdate(); System.out.println(rows+" updated
	successfully") write in postgres first to check you are getting it
	right. copy and paste replace amounts with ?s. done for the day. Very
	happy with what we learned and feel ready to complete huge chunks of P
	zero.</p>
<h3>Evening:</h3>
<p>And here we are in the evening. 4:54pm. Going to make the updates
	to bank app that we learned in our product app during class today and
	create table. I added the table and will see how it connects in the
	morning.</p>

<h2>21/02/22</h2>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
	Starting QC now! Wish me luck. <br /> Think I did well but definitely
	got the answer wrong a bit. My questions were what is Maven? Where does
	Maven get dependencies from? What are scalar and aggregate functions in
	SQL? The correct answer is Scalar functions perform an operation on
	values returned from a query. Such as UCASE(), LCASE(), LENGTH(),
	ROUND(). Aggregate functions calculate on a set of values and return a
	single value. Some examples are: AVG(), COUNT(), MIN(), MAX(), SUM().

	Here are some questions for other people: What is difference between
	WHERE and HAVING? What is POM.xml used for? What are some SQL
	datatypes? Define method overloading and method overriding? What is a
	wrapper class? What is SQL and why is it important for us as
	developers? What is a schema? (name removed) does a good job of
	creating a story when answering. Something to use when knowing the
	answer. What is a transaction? What properties must a transaction
	follow? What are generics? Write an example of generics. Can you tell
	me the difference between a List and a Set? What is a map in Java?
	Difference between ALTER and UPDATE commands? What is a JOIN? <br /> <br />
	THE ART OF THE ANSWER: Answer with correct answer AND give GREAT
	example personal to my RECENT experience. The correct answer alone does
	not prove I know the answer. DONT: Say I think, UMM, I believe, that's
	my best guess, I'm not sure, I don't know. Even if you don't know, no
	one cares. Respond like you know and you have a chance of being right.
	Humility does not matter in an interview they are making an investment
	on you and your ability. <br /> I'm going to do better on the next QC
	or project presentation. I know how to do better. <br /> It's been
	taking a while for this QC. Started at 7am my time and now it's 11:31.
	Not sure if that's a bad sign, but I hope my fellow classmates are safe
	and our teacher too. The topics we've went over take a lot of repition
	and hands on experience. Let's see what happens but the anticipation is
	killing me.

</p>
<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
<p>
	We are going to start the day after QC with a coding challenge. Coding
	challenge was pretty easy. Now we are learning JDBC so we have it for
	building out projects. Java Database Connectivity Connects Java to
	SQL/Database GUI and CUI to DB to have the proper drivers for postgres
	to talk with JAVA you to- Class.forName("org.postgresql.Driver"); throw
	an exception for it Very cool that all we have to do is add the
	dependency code to the pom.xml file and poof. It's connected. Next I
	assume we go to DBeaver and connect from there. This stuff is dope. <a
		href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.postgresql/postgresql/42.3.3">JDBC
		Driver</a> and some documentation fun- <a
		href="https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/80/connect.html">JDBC
		Docs</a> also I am trying to fit in the HTC (how to code) course in the
	free time that doesn't exist. I know it creates good practices. <a
		href="https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:UBCx+HtC1x+2T2017/home">HTC
		Simple Data</a> Overloading is process by which we have same method name
	and different parameters. What is difference between abstract class and
	interface? Maven gets dependencies from. What is driver? What is types
	of driver? Going to take a breather after this class and get back in
	later on to update my learning app. I think I mainly feel there are so
	many individual things to memorize for QCs that I don't get a strong
	handle on what is asked. As Mohammad said.. instead of trying to
	memorize things word for word I'm going to take the most important
	points and know them in and out entirely. The core fundamentals. When
	he brought up the question about differencies between abstract class
	and interface it leaves me somewhat unsure... like I could answer the
	memorized answer when it was asked 3 weeks ago, but now I just know an
	interface allows for multiple inheritance and abstract classes must
	have their methods implemented by child classes.. is that right? After
	looking <a
		href="https://www.javatpoint.com/difference-between-abstract-class-and-interface">here</a>
	I think the correct answer is- Abstract class can have abstract and
	non-abstract methods. Interface can only have abstract methods.
	Interface supports multiple inheritance and abstract classes do not.
	Abstract class can implement an interface but interface cant implement
	an abstract class. Interface can only extend another interface. Maybe I
	do the definition with workable examples as I talked about before. Okay
	that's enough! See you later.

<!-- POST Diary entries below -->

<h2>20/02/22</h2>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>It's 5:35am on a Sunday and I need to memorize 100 ideas from the
	last week. I need to break it into smaller fun chunks of information.
	My imagination has to take over to make this work. Let's see what I
	have available.</p>
<p>
	I had this idea for a video game style learning adventure. It would
	probably translate well to VR. Immersive walk through experience. Like
	you enter your memory area a place special to you. A place you know.
	And then the game develops ideas based on what you need to learn and in
	the best way for you to learn. Some ideas are people and groups of
	people with personalities, some ideas are buildings or homes, some are
	objects, some are billboards, some are a videogame within a videogame,
	it's endless. Where is your infinite well of knowledge and how can it
	be made visual? I'm a visual learner so it's a necessity for me. Track
	where it is in your brain based on your interactions. Instead of
	feeling like you are being quizzed it's like walking up to someone and
	trying to remember their name. A different type of pressure. Can I
	start now? How best to do so? Just to start I suppose. It starts in
	eclipse. I've built out the learning project similar to our banking app
	example. I want it to feel and work great, but I don't know how to
	think about doing it. And I worry that just by starting I'm going to
	make mistakes that would save me headaches in the future. I think at
	this stage of my learning this is inevitable and I just have to
	continue. So anyways I've made a App class that creats a LearnApp
	object to call the startLearnApp method. This keeps App.java as basic
	as possible and opens from my custom class of LearnApp.java. I then
	created a Learn.java class that I will use as my model. <br />
	Honestly doing this is freightening. <br /> The amount of mistakes I
	can make is infinite, but this is better than index cards in my mind.
	So it's worth testing. Looking at the BankDAO.java class I can add
	methods to this app in a LearnDAO.java for: public void
	addMemoryItem(Learn item); public void updateMemoryItem(Learn item);
	public void deleteMemoryItem(int memoryId); public void
	searchByMemoryId(int memoryId); public void searchByMemoryName(String
	memoryName); public void printAllMemoryItems(); <br /> but I'm going
	to save this for later. I just want to fill this with information that
	I need now. I ended up just building out LearnDAO.java and
	LearnDAOImpl.java because it was too easy not to. Now I am faced with
	buildng a new object for each memory area or doing it all in
	LearnApp.java... My gut tells me to do a new class for each area. Let
	me try that and see how it goes. <br /> I'm back at the desk after
	family woke up. Debating on attending an OSSU cohort that meets in 4
	minutes. I dont want to take on anything that distracts me, but maybe
	it could be fresh? Idk. Couldnt hurt to try 1 and see how it goes. I've
	tried before in the past but didn't feel it pulling me along like I
	needed. <br /> Just went on a long Maven run with creating a
	learning-app project and injesting all the data into it. I now have a
	project I can build dynamically week after week. I kind of suprised
	myself a bit with this one and am happy with the outcome. I can add it
	to github so I can study from my other computer as well.

<h2>18/02/22</h2>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
	Downloaded atom on this windows so I can diary my thoughts a bit
	better. I've been trying to keep notes but theyve been a bit bare.
	Let's see if this helps. Most of what we are learning right now is to
	build our bank app. Which is project 0 in this training course. We are
	using SQL Shell for postgresql alongside with DBeaver to show how
	running multiple threads can cause a lock up. We just looked at
	savepoints between updates and inserts so that we can rollback to
	specific points. This is new for me. <br /> <br /> To study: 4 levels
	of isolation we can select for RDBMS- <br /> Serializable <br />
	Repeatable Reads <br /> Read Committed <br /> Read Uncommitted <br />
	<br /> Now we are done talking about transactions. On to DDL:
	Truncate, create, alter, drop. Now we are learning about creating a
	table and inserting items. It's cool because we are able to check in
	the SQL Shell as we do so. We just used primary key, unique, and check
	to create constraints for the items we are adding to table. The DBeaver
	was doing some weird things when trying to create and drop tables with
	the Auto-Commit disabled for Manual Committ (Read Committed). This is
	something to be aware of when building out tables for Bank project. On
	to our first 20 minute break. Good day so far. Having music on in the
	background makes a huge difference for me. I've disabled spell check
	and trying to remove the autocomplete without making it a hassle to
	write inside here. Back to listening to Mohammad. Now we are learning
	about auto incrementing for primary key into table. Using serial,
	sequence. Sequence is nice because you can modify the start and
	increment amount. <br /> Feeling pretty good about this table stuff.
	I'm having some fun with it by using my Philadelphia friend's names. I
	need to do that more often to get comfortable. Now we are on to
	Normalization- Helps us to break the table into different parts We are
	moving to foreign keys because he cant find document pertaining to
	normalization. When the primary key of one table is available in
	another as a non primary key column-> foreign key. Foreign key is very
	easy to understand. Sort of like a door from one table to another. I
	feel like we get way too much time to do the examples. We could do
	twice as many. Why not give us the proposed example as well as an
	advanced example for those of us moving a bit faster? I find myself
	either trying to find examples online or my mind wandering a bit at
	leaset 25% of the class. on delete cascade is used for a child table to
	delete all referenced instances when using delete from students where
	studentId = 211; ^my specific example. Next QC is on Monday from 10am -
	12pm EST. Week 2: Maven Git Wrapper Classes Abstract Interfaces
	StringBuilder String Buffer Overloading CollectionAPI Unit Testing
	JUnit Week 3: Postgres 2/16 all but normalization 2/17 no JDBC nothing
	on 2/18 referential integrity constraints data types TCL <br />
	Mohammad updated the curriculum found here: <a
		href="https://app.revature.com/curriculum/12767/batch/1211/viewCalendar">HERE</a>
	<br /> After break we will cover rest of topics and prepare for QC.
	SQL Quiz questions QC questions Mohammad will share with us. <br /> <br />
	Possible QC QuestionS: What is referential integrity? <br /> <br />
	ALTER TABLE statements to add, drop, Alter makes changes to table
	structure Update makes changes to values/data On to Set Operators Union

	Union All Intersect returns the same items from each table Except/Minus
	returns distinct rows selected by 1st query not present in 2nd query.

	Have all the QC resources from Mohammad saved to ->
	C:\Users\Winterfam\Desktop\Revature\QC_PREPARE\QC_Week2_Week3 Im using
	GIT on here to push to my github repo. I like the public nature of what
	I am doing being open to anyone, anytime. Back from another 20 minute
	break that I spent at my computer. <br /> Back to normalization- to
	reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. and we are done for
	the day. I'll be back to prepare notes / index cards for the QC
