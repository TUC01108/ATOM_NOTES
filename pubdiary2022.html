Interview today at 3pm PST with Infosys. Can't wait and going to give it
my best. Feel really prepared just depends what they ask. Hope I can talk
a lot about my experience using the technologies in our projects as that's
what I feel most comfortable with.

Training starts now.
I've been filling in the gaps with more index cards for questions I don't have 100%.
Worked from 3:30pm to 9pm straight just breaking to put O down for nap twice and dinner.
Easy to study so much when the topics are so interesting.

What is a web driver in selenium ?
Selenium WebDriver tool is used to automate web application testing to verify that it works as expected. It supports many
browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, IE, and Safari

What is Java?

What is a hashmap?
key/values
Java HashMap class from collections that implements the Map interface which allows us to store key and value pair, where keys
should be unique. If you try to insert the duplicate key, it will replace the element of the
corresponding key. hash means order is not guaranteed.

Difference between float and double?
float is 32-bit, double is 64-bit.
4 bytes, 8 bytes.
double is default

What is a string?
A string is an immutable object in java that is not a primitive data type. From java.lang class.
String is a character array.

String word = "spelling";
String word = new String("spelling");

What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding?
method overloading is compile time polymorphism where you use the same method name in same class but different signature.
method overriding is runtime polymorphism where you use the same signature from parent class in child class using inheritance.

When a child class calls a method that both the child and parent share which one gets executed?
child.

What is a static variable?
The static variable gets memory only once in class scope at the time of class loading.
Static variables are initialized only one time, i.e. at the start of the execution. These variables will
 be initialized first, before the initialization of any instance variables.

Default vs protected access modifiers?
Default: The access level of a default modifier is only within the package. It cannot be accessed from
outside the package. If you do not specify any access level, it will be the default.

Protected: The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through
child class. If you do not make the child class, it cannot be accessed from outside the package.

Very comfortable with selenium.

findElement() returns the first web element which matches the locator.
findElements() returns all the web elements which match the locator.

WebDriver driver = new EdgeDriver();

We have used JUnit.

Annotation sequence-
@BeforeClass
	@Before
	@After
@AfterClass

We use maven for handling our dependencies for Java and Spring Boot projects.
maven is a strong project management tool used to build and manage java related projects.

What HTTP methods are you aware of?
GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

GET method-
	GET is used to request data from a specified resource.
POST method-
	POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
	The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request
PUT method-
	PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

	The difference between POST and PUT is that PUT requests are idempotent. That is, calling the same PUT
	request multiple times will always produce the same result. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly
	have side effects of creating the same resource multiple times.

Status code 200 and 404?
	200 is OK response, 404 is not found

JAX-RS-
	java  API for RESTful web services

Have you developed any web service using Java?
	yes in our latest project we created a 3rd iteration of a social media platform,

final keyword cant be changed
final class cannot be inherited
final method cannot be overriden

Different members of agile process?
Product Owner, project sponsor, scrum master, agile mentor, development team members, dev team lead, stakeholders.

Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Inheritance.
abstraction- through abstract class or interface.
encapsulation- is data hiding achieved through getters and setters in a pojo.
Polymorphism- Method overloading and overriding
Inheritance- method overriding, extends keyword

How do you create a selenium web driver object?
	- WebDriver driver = new EdgeDriver();

Have you used Jira?
	No, but I know it can be used to track bugs and defects within a project.

Have you used waterfall?
	Yes, I have used in an example project to see how it works. It's great for when the project wont change from beginning
	to end. Very clear and defined purpose. Hard to change path.

Collections is a class and framework

framework-
Iterable>Collection>List, Queue, and Set
	List>ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector
	Queue>
	Set>


Collection is an interface
	List, set, map interfaces
</p>
<p>
	What is Java ?
	Java is a high level object oriented programming language. Write once, runs anywhere due to JVM platform dependence making Java os independent.

	What is JDK,JVM, JRE?
	JDK is java development kit includes JVM and JRE as well as compiler, debugger, doc tools, and comman line utilities.
	JVM is java virtual machine which includes JRE and api libraries.
	JRE is java run time environment for running java code.

	What is the command to compile a java program ?
	javac

	Why we use packages in java? Name few built in packages ?
	organizing files
	packages are used to import into a class other classes that you'd like to use. such as java.lang, java.util,

	What are some non -access modifiers ?
	Static, abstract, final, synchronized

	What is a constructor in java?
	A constructor is a special method that has same name as class it's within and is called when object instantiated.

	What are the variable scopes ?
	instance, local, block, class - static

	What is Garbage collection  ? Can we call GC explicitly ?
	Garbage collection is java's way to clean up unused memory. We cannot call GC explicitly but we can ask it to clean up
	by writing System.gc() or Runtime.gc()

	What are the access modifiers in java ?
	private, default, protected, public

	What is Object class in java ? List some methods of object class?
	is the super class of all classes in java. methods- clone(), finalize(), getClass(), hashCode(), notify().

	What is exception?
	exception is when something does not go as planned within a program and the system either asks you to handle at compile time (checked) or alerts you at runtime (unchecked)

	What is checked and unchecked exception ?
	Explained above

	What is the super class of all the exception in java ?
	Throwable is the super class of all exceptions in java

	How you create custom exceptions in java ?
	extend Exception class (checked) or RuntimeException(unchecked) and overide the constructor and methods.

	What is the use of try with resources ?
	Try with resources closes all the resources (file, database connection, network connection etc.) automatically.

	Difference between string buffer and string builder ?
	String buffer is thread safe, string builder is not thread safe, and faster, more efficient

	What is JDBC ?
	java database connection
	for connection java applications to database

	Types of JDBC drivers ?
	we use type 4 driver or pure java driver

	Difference between Statement,PreparedStatement ?
	statement is for static database queries
	preparedstatement is for dynamic sql statements with user input in queries and is safe from sql injection

	What is the use of CallableStatement ?
	used for stored procedures in sql.
	You can create an object of the CallableStatement (interface) using the prepareCall () method of the Connection interface.

	After lunch will be sql & testing.

Spring recap this morning.
	framework is an inversion of control container that provides flexible infrastructural support to
	creat loosely coupled Java applications by utilizing dependency injection.

Inversion of Control is a design principle in which control over certain parts of object oriented
design is inverted to achieve loose coupling.

Dependency Injection
	removes dependencies of a program by providing the configuration in an external source

Aspect Oriented Programming

Was hoping to setup a pipeline from jenkins to project 2 but computer
is acting up. Let's see if it decides to work itself out.

Had to move all contents of downloads folder over to a temp downloads from cmd line.

C:\users\[accountname]\downloads type md c:\download_temp and press return.
 C:\users\[accountname]\downloads move *.* c:\download_temp and press return

This fixed it.

Used this in new location of jenkins.war file

Focusing on setting up Selenium and cucumber inside DoctorFinder project to prepare for infosys interview.
I'm actually really excited to get this job, but lots of hard work in next few days before we are closer.

I'm going back to ERS project to see how JUnit and Selenium was setup so I can implement in DoctorFinder
as well and be able to talk about in my interview.
JUnit with selenium is nice and straight forward-
	setup the test by specifying the browser in a string and WebDriver driver;
	Do @BeforeAll if needed and @AfterAll
	@BeforeEach is where we check what browser the person has on system for test.
		WebDriverManager.edgedriver().setup;
		driver = new EdgeDriver();

	Then the test has @Test above can do @DisplayName("NAME OF TEST") as well
		driver.get("url");
		driver.manage().window().maximize();
		// then you add the locators
		drover.findElement(By.xpath("xpath")).click();
		use .sendkeys("what to send");

		check if window gets to next page 	assertTrue(driver.findElement(By.id("somethingonnextpage")).isDisplayed());

	@AfterEach
	public void tearDown() {
		driver.close();
		driver.quit();
	}

I didn't realize the above was JUnit with Selenium until I started running tests.
Anything testing the web page is selenium from what we've learned.

I just created an all JUnit test case for EmployeeDAOImpl that test all the Employee DAO implementations.
It went easier than I thought it would. Definitely should write tests before code going forward.

Next will be cucumber so I feel great about everything they will interview us for.
</p>
<p>
Before we get to cucumber we have made 10 Tests for ERS JUnit and Selenium. All passing.
Now to try cucumber in here.


Okay so to do cucumber from scratch you must-
	create a Features folder in src>test>resources and a .feature file
	feature file has a Feature, Scenario, Given, When, Then, and any details needed (login username & password)
	then you run the feature file as Cucumber feature and copy the provided outline to use in class.
	You create a new class in test folder com.training.cucumber > ERSLoginSteps
	Add browser and WebDriver and PageFactory and paste the steps provided in previous step
	Write out each test as described in their human readable instructions.

Really cool to implement this in project I have running. I can add those features to the readme.md
as well.

I updated the github. portfolio as well.

And changed the branch to joel/2fa for revspace3 for the active changes so joel could pull from there.

Lambda Expressions were added in Java 8. A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in
parameters and returns a value. Lambda expressions are similar to methods, but they do not need a name
and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.

comparable interface-
	compareTo method

comparator interface-
	A comparator interface is used to order the objects of user-defined classes. A comparator object is
	capable of comparing two objects of the same class. Following function compare obj1 with obj2.
	public int compare(Object obj1, Object obj2)

angular is a frontend  framework used to create web application

webpack is a static module bundler for JavaScript applications that packages all modules in our application
into a bundle and servies it to the browser.

typescript-
	is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. It is
	designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript.

What is a decorator?
	There are four main types of angular decorators:

	Class decorators, such as @Component and @NgModule
	Property decorators for properties inside classes, such as @Input and @Output
	Method decorators for methods inside classes, such as @HostListener
	Parameter decorators for parameters inside class constructors, such as @Inject

Directives-
	Directives allow us to manipulate the DOM

Pipes-
	for transforming values in angular template

Promises vs Observables
	In Angular, we can use either Promises or Observables for handling asynchronous data.

	The difference is - a Promise emits a single value while Observable can emit multiple values. So,
	while handling a HTTP request, a Promise can manage a single response for the same request, but if
	there are multiple responses to the same request, then we have to use an Observable.

These are the topics to study for our Interview with infosys-

Selenium
Cucumber
Junit

selenium
Selenium is an open-source (free) automated testing framework for validating web applications across
multiple browsers and platforms. Selenium Test Scripts can be written in a variety of programming
languages, including Java, C#, Python, and others. Selenium Testing is the term for testing done using
the Selenium testing tool.

Selenium Remote Control (RC)
Selenium WebDriver
Selenium Grid

Selenium Integrated Development Environment (IDE): It is a Firefox/Chrome plug-in that is developed to
speed up the creation of automation scripts by recording the user actions on the web browser and
exporting them as a reusable script.

Selenium Remote Control (RC): It is a server that enables users to generate test scripts in their
preferred programming language. It accepts commands from the test scripts and sends them to the browser
as Selenium core JavaScript commands, for the browser to behave accordingly.

Selenium WebDriver: It is a programming interface that helps create and run test cases by directly
communicating with the web browser and using its native compatibility to automate. Unlike RC, it
doesn’t require an additional server to create and run test cases.

Selenium Grid: It allows parallel execution of tests on different browsers and operating systems by
distributing commands to different machines simultaneously

git pull origin main
git fetch --all
git stash
git checkout group1/2fa

variable scopes-
class/static scope, instance/object scope, local scope, block scope

Constructor-
	When we use the new keyword in order to create an object, the JVM is invoking a special class member called a constructor. A constructor declares how an object is to be instantiated and initialized from the class "blueprint". A constructor is declared like a method, except its method signature does not contain a return type, and a constructor always has the same name as the class. The new object created by the constructor is always of the class in which the constructor is declared.

this keywod-
	this refers to the object which is being instantiated - it is used to initialize instance variables, or - to call other constructors (this is called constructor chaining)

autoboxing /unboxing
	automatic conversion of primitives to

SQL
	DDL, DML, DQL, DCL

DQL-
		Data Query Language is the sub language where only the SELECT statement exists.
	Group By, Having

	Scalar functions operate on individual values and will perform some operation per row, and can be
	used in the SELECT or WHERE clause.
		TO_CHAR()
		TO_DATE()

Recap of core java topics.

java features
	strongly typed
	garbage collection
	object-oriented
	platform independent

which methods are in the object class?
	toString

Order of initialization
	static variables
	static initializers
	instance variables
	instance initializers
	controllers

Size of an int variable is 32 bits (4 bytes)

Default type of variable used for decimals is double.

What is JRE / JDK / JVM.
	JVM is java virtual machine
	JRE is java runtime environment that contains the JVM and libraries
	JDK is the java development kit that contains JRE and JVM along with compiler, debugger, and more.

Implicit modifiers for interface variables
	public static final
Implicit modifiers for interface methods
	public abstract
Difference between abstract class and interface
		Abstract class vs Interface
		Type of methods: Interface can have only abstract methods. An abstract class can have abstract and
		non-abstract methods. From Java 8, it can have default and static methods also.
		Final Variables: Variables declared in a Java interface are by default final. An abstract class may
		contain non-final variables.
		Type of variables: Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables. The
		interface has only static and final variables.
		Implementation: Abstract class can provide the implementation of the interface. Interface can’t
		provide the implementation of an abstract class.
		Inheritance vs Abstraction: A Java interface can be implemented using the keyword “implements” and
		an abstract class can be extended using the keyword “extends”.
		Multiple implementations: An interface can extend another Java interface only, an abstract class can
		extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces.
		Accessibility of Data Members: Members of a Java interface are public by default. A Java abstract
		class can have class members like private, protected, etc.

Datatypes- boolean, short, int, long, float, double, char, byte

method overriding is when a child rewrites the method from parent class

method overloading is within the same class when a method is written with a different signature.

collection and collections
	collection is an interface
	collections is a data structure library

static
	belongs to the class. Used for memory management.

why static in main
	The main() method is static so that JVM can invoke it without instantiating the class. This also saves
	the unnecessary wastage of memory which would have been used by the object declared only for calling
	the main() method by the JVM.

Compiler
	Transforms the source code into byte code.

Most people use spring initializr to setup their projects.

Dependencies we've used: Spring Web, DevTools, Lombok, PostgresQL, Spring Security.

Application.properties file for configuration
pom.xml for dependencies
Tomcat server is what Spring is built on by default

Spring framework allows you to cut out a lot of boilerplate code and focus on creating enterprise
applications with Java.
Offers IoC and enables transactions.

Projects: Spring Boot, Spring Framework, Spring Data, Spring Cloud, Spring Security

Spring Boot is built on top of Spring framework. Auto configured.
Custom configurations with @Annotation. No XML configuration necessary.
Great for stand alone APIs.

IoC- instead of the programmer deciding flow of application or what objects are created, its
all handed over to the Spring Container.
Dependency Injection- inject an instance inside another class instead of using the new keyword.
instead of inner code when we need to instantiate an object, spring instantiates it for us.

Spring Beans- an instance of a class managed by the Spring Container. Spring decides when to
create and when to destroy.

Spring Container- part of the core Spring Framework, responsible for managing all beans, performs
dependency injection.

stereotype @- service, controller, repository, restcontroller

@SpringBootApplication (collection of spring annotations)
		@componentscan scans application for components
		@EnableAutoConfiguration
		@SpringBootConfiguration
		@Inherited
		@Documented
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spring Framework provides patterns and structure for application
Application context- Spring manages object instances
DI- makes sure that every object has references to all the other instances they require
Database connectivity with JDBC- data access apis and mechanisms for connectivity, querying,
and transaction management
Spring MVC- web framework lets you easily create web applications and REST API

REST API- Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State.

@restcontroller is a combination of the @controller and @ResponseBody
annotation.

RestController: RestController is used for making restful web services
with the help of the @RestController annotation
@RestController is for app to app
returns a json

@Controller provides a view so that user
returns a view

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Projects- Spring data, spring security, spring boot, spring integration
Modules- AOP, JDBC, ORM

2.  What is IOC and what does the IOC Container do?

    Inversion of Control is a design principle in which control over certain parts of object-oriented design is inverted to achieve loose coupling.
    IoC Container (a.k.a. DI Container) is a framework for implementing automatic dependency injection. It manages object creation and it's life-time, and also injects
    dependencies to the class.

3.  What is dependency injection and what are some of the benefits of using dependency injection?

Dependency Injection is a design patters that removes dependencies of a program by providing the
configuration in an external source, such as an ML file.
    This loosely coupled design then makes code easier to test, and implement in a wider variety

4.  What types of Dependency injection does spring support?
	setter
	constructor

5.  What are some differences between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext? Which one eagerly instantiates your beans?

    The ApplicationContext comes with advanced features, including several that are geared towards enterprise applications,
    while the BeanFactory comes with only basic features. Therefore, it's generally recommended to use the ApplicationContext, and we should use BeanFactory only
    when memory consumption is critical.0

    BeanFactory will create a bean object when the getBean() method is called thus making it Lazy initialization.
    ApplicationContext loads all the beans and creates objects at the time of startup only thus making it Eager initialization.

6.  What is the Spring Bean lifecycle?

		-1. Bean Instantiated
		-2. Dependencies Injected
		-3. Custom init() method
		-4. Custom utility method
		-5. Custom destroy() method

7.  What is bean wiring? What about autowiring?

		Autowiring- automatically inject the bean.

8.  What are the different ways that Spring can wire beans?

		    We wire beans in the beans.xml OR using annotations.
				ByName, ByType, constructor

9.  What are the scopes of Spring beans? Which is default?

    -1) Singleton Scope (default) - Each bean definition is scoped to a single object instance per Spring IoC Container.
    -2) Prototype Scope - A single bean definition is scoped to a number of object instances.
    -3) Request Scope [Only valid with a web-aware ApplicationContext] - A single bean definition is scoped to the lifecycle of a single HTTP request. This means the HTTP request has its own instance of a bean created from a single bean definition.
    -4) Session Scope [Only valid with a web-aware ApplicationContext] - A single bean definition is scoped to the lifecycle of an HTTP Session.
    -5) Gloabl Session Scope [Only valid with a web-aware ApplicationContext] - A single bean definition is scoped to the lifecycle of a global HTTP session. Generally only valid when used in a portlet context.
    -6) Application Scope

10.  What is the concept of component scanning and how would you set it up?
		In order to autowire or inject primitives, the @ComponentScan annotation specifies where to
		search for defined beans.
		Additionally all of these beans must be imported from the org.springframework.context.annotation
		package.

11.  What are the benefits and limitations of Java configuration?

    -1. Separation of concerns
    -2. Technology agnostic
    -3. Ability to integrate Spring with external libraries

12.  What does the @Configuration and @Bean annotations do?

		@Configuration- Spring annotation indicates a class file used to manage bean configurations
		using Java configuration similar to the Application Context file for an XML
		or annotation based configuration.

		you can use @Bean-annotated methods with any class which is @Component-annotated;
    however, they are most commonly used with @Configuration beans since the primary
		purpose for a class which is @Configuration-annotated is the definition of beans.

13.  What is @Value used for?



14.  What is Spring Expression Language? What can you reference using SpEL? What is the difference
between $ and # in @value expressions?

Joins
	bookId
	bookName
	List Story storyList = new ArrayList<>();

Tufail gave us a one to many example in eclipse

Now we are creating jenkins build off of join table.

For running jenkins (in folder with .war file)-
	java -jar jenkins.war

Feel good about jenkins for what we know about it.
I'm guessing the developers will push to repository where
our jenkins will update with buils based on tests that we create
and manage. As devops we need to maintain good code that keeps
production code up and running. Prevent breaks.

Here are commands if ever need to change java_home in cmd-
				--Starting Jenkins---
				set path=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_321\bin
				set java_home=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_321
				java -jar jenkins.war

*************************************************
**********************************QC*************

What is spring?
	The Spring Framework is an inversion of control container that provides flexible
	infrastructural support to create loosely coupled Java applications by utilizing
	dependency injection.


What is auto wiring?
	Autowiring feature of spring framework enables you to inject the object dependency
	implicitly.


What is a bean in spring?
	the objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the
	Spring IoC container

What are stereotype annotation in Spring Boot?
	Spring Framework provides us with some special annotations. These annotations are
	used to create Spring beans automatically in the application context. @Component
	annotation is the main Stereotype Annotation. There are some Stereotype
	meta-annotations which is derived from @Component those are:
	@Component, @Service, @Repository, and @Controller

What is @Service?
	We specify a class with @Service to indicate that they’re holding the business logic.
	Besides being used in the service layer, there isn’t any other special use for this
	annotation. The utility classes can be marked as Service classes.

What is @Repository?
	We specify a class with @Repository to indicate that they’re dealing with CRUD
	operations, usually, it’s used with DAO (Data Access Object) or Repository
	implementations that deal with database tables.

What is @Controller?
	We specify a class with @Controller to indicate that they’re front controllers and
	responsible to handle user requests and return the appropriate response. It is mostly
	used with REST Web


What is IOC?

What is DI?

			responseEntity = new ResponseEntity String(result,HttpStatus.CREATED); //201
	}
	return responseEntity;

Now our application is completely ready for client operations
But we go on a break for 20 min now.
</p>
<p>
Back

Let's connect everything together-
go to product.service.ts in angular
and change URL to http://localhost:5050

using angular to make restful calls
	CORS
		cross origin resource sharing
		restricts entites from accessing resources belonging to other srevers
		just add @CrossOrigin in Spring ProductController
		@CrossOrigin(origins="http://localhost:4200")

		update product.service.ts in angular and change the retries to 0

Zoom is freezing up. Have to restart the system.
</p>
<p>
-----------------------------
in add-.component.ts
change
and in list.component.ts

always feels like you are completely lost when you enter a meeting and tufail is mid-
explaining something. think I'm caught up now.

Back from lunch-

Spring is not for small applications

==============================================
Autowiring
	don't have to write in the ref/property values one by one.
	--
	This is an automagical
 process in which bean references don't need to be coded explicitly in the XML
 bean definition file, but rather the Spring container works out dependencies.
	--
can autowire byName or byType

Annotations-
	can be written via XML or annotations

create a copy of the spring-basics project
spring-basics-annotations
	delete beans.xml file
create new class
AppConfig inside config package

add the spring annotations maven dependency 5.3.17
@Configuration
public
	@Bean
	public Address getAddress() {
		return new Address();
	}

	@Bean
	public Customer getCustomer() {
		return new Customer();
	}
change SpringApp to
	ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);

	Address address = context.getBean(Address.class);
	Customer customer = context.getBean(Customer.class);

	address.setAddressId(1222);
	address.setCity("London");
	address.setState("UK");
	address.setZipcode(918171);

	customer.setCustomerId(1);
	customer.setCustomerName("Tony");
	customer.setCustomerAddress("US");
	customer.setBillAmount(94000);

	customer.setAddress(address)

	syso(customer);


</p>
<p>
	----------------------------
Went on 20 minute break.

Starting on Project 1 for the day.

What do I need to do.

Employee-
Update information

Manager-
1) Login
@) View Manager homepage
3) logout
4) approve/deny pending reimbursement requests
5) view all pending of all employees
6) view all resolved of all employees
7) view reimbursement requests of a specific employee
8) view all employees
------------------

maybe I take out the easy ones first so I know what will take me most time.
Start with manager and work through the DAO methods-
5,6,7,8,4 in that order.

</p>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
Today is P1 day. Get it done and make it great.

Learning SPRING
---------------------------------
	The Spring Framework is an inversion of control container that provides flexible
	infrastructural support to create loosely coupled Java applications by utilizing
	dependency injection.

	DI/IOC

					first admire the features of what you are learning
	The object is pushed to the project in Spring framework.
	Application becomes loosely coupled.
	Spring container

Spring Core
==================================
create mave project in eclipse
quickstart>next>
group id: com.training.spring
artifact id: spring-basics

new class in com.training.spring
Employee
	private String employeeName;
	default constructor
	getters and setters

go to app.jaava
	Employee employee = ew Employee();
	employee.setEmployeeName("Alex");
----------------------------------------------
go to pom.xml
	add spring dependency
	spring core maven- 5.3.17

create a beans.xml in com.training.spring
	bean id="emp" class="com.training.spring.Employee"
	add spring beans dependency

create new class SpringApp.java
	with main
	Resource resource = new ClassPathResource("beans.xml");
	BeanFactory factory = new XmlBeanFactory(resource);

	Employee emp1 = (Employee) factory.getBean("emp");

	emp1.setEmployeeName("Mark");
	Syso(emp1.getEmployeeName());

Two types of injection
	constructor
	setter

create class in com.training.spring
Customer.java
	private int customerId;
	private String customerName;
	private String customerAddress;
	private int billAmount;

	default onstructor

	param constructor with fields
	setters and getters
	toString

go to beans.xml
	create bean
	bean id="cust" class="com.training.spring.Customer"
		property name="customerId" value="1999"
		property name="customerName" value="Joseph"
		property name="customerAddress" value="NewYork"
		property name="billAmount" value="189900"

go to SpringApp.java
	Customer cust = (Customer)factory.getBean
	Syso(cust)

create class
Address
	addressId
	city
	state
	zipcode

	create 2 beans- address1 & address2
		1) by setter
		2) by constructor
	print both

</p>
<p>
Back from break.

*******
IOC-
	In Spring, the IoC Container is responsible for instantiating, configuring and assembling objects known as beans

back to project------------------------------------------
go to Customer.java
private Address address;
remove all code from Customer and rewrite
generate constructor with fields
getters and setters
toString

go to beans.xml
property name="address" ref="address2"

got to SpringApp.java

comment out the emp's
----------------------
create an Email class
To
	toName
	fromEmail
From
Subject
Body message

create 5 classes

new project
spring-email-exercse
copy and paste SpringApp and beans.xml
To, From, Subject, Body classes
Email must have these 4 properties.

This is cool what we are doing.

Strength in Spring.

Half my brain is on reserve so I can get this project done when training ends
today.

<p>
Back again.
What needs to get done?
Need to work out edit employee info logic and then do manager tasks one by one.
I'll get it done.

</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
<p>
Back from break after the QC.

Group project has been assigned.
Looks like our group is Alex, Joseph, Trey.
nvm it is Andre, Wenjian, Devyn, and myself.

Set up git to work together.

1 group leader responsible for project. will assign tasks to others.
Trello- setup

Let's see who wants to be the leader.

After class ends I'll go for a walk with O, but have to cut it short so I can
work on P1. I need to finish it and have a lot to do.

Must stay focused and finish tasks in order of priority to create a functional app.
We are presenting to Tufail so all the pressure for presenting is gone.

</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
Finish off this studying for QC WEEK7.

Starting training now

Instead of using a fake json server we will use Spring.

Tufail assigning groups today for Project 2.
Lunch is early today at 10am PT, QC at 11am.
Quiz for Angular

project 3 presentation on 4/21.
infosys client interview
</p>
<p>
Recap
-------------------------------------------------------
Node.js
	allows us to run JS outside a web browser
npm-
	package manager for JS.
why do we need node.js
	browser only understands js so node.js and npm perfrom this compilation from TS
package.json
	This file is used to give information to npm that allows it to identify the project
	as well as handle the project's dependencies.
	npm init
		generates the package.json file
angular.json-
	can change landing page from index.html
Angular CLI
	takes care of the configuration and initialization of various libraries
	for setting up our Angular App / npm install
Webpack
	module bundler of JS applications. packages all modules and serves to browser
SPA
	web app that fits on single page in browser uses a single load for css. gmail, facebook, trello.
	navigate between pages without refreshing whole page. AJAX, HTML5
History
	changed from AngularJS to Angluar from version 2. We are on version 13.
Decorators
	An Angular Decorator is a function, using which we attach metadata to a class, method,
	accessor, property, or parameter.
Component Lifecycle methods
	ngOnInit, ngOnChange
2-way binding

1-way binding
Directives
	Structural
	Attribute
Pipes
	used for transforming values in the angular template using | character
	ex: uppercase, lowercase, slice, date, decimal, currency, percent, json, async, wordcount





</p>
<p>
And we are at lunch but I am studying through to prepare for this QC.

</p>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
Back and ready to study full on for tomorrow's QC. Allergies kicked my butt yesterday
into this morning and I didnt even get off the couch to go to garage.

Going to copy and paste from yesterday so I have the study notes continuing-
Built-in pipes
	{{ dateToday | date | uppercase }}
	{{ dateToday | date: 'short'| lowercase }}	(colon sign allows for argument)
	using {{ name| uppercase }}
	using {{ name | slice:6 }}
Custom pipes
	@pipe
	create a typescript class
	decorate with the @pipe decorator
	implement the pipe transform
	return the transformed data
	add pipe class to the declarations array
	OR
	ng g pipe nameofthepipe
Pure and Impure Pipes
	All are pure by default
	An impure pipe is called for every change
	detection cycle no matter whether the value or parameter (s) changes
-------------------------------
</p>
<p>
Next-
Services and Dependency Injection
Services
	An Angular service is a singleton instance that can be injected into multiple
	components, where the component utilizes the functions defined in a service class.
	This allows us to reuse the code.
	_____.service.ts
	We use a Dependency Injection framework to inject the service into components in our app.
Dependency Injection (DI)
	is a design pattern

Think I understand this better. In my own words-
Services are for storing data thats to be used across multiple components.
The benefit is that if data changes then you only have to change in one place.
And allows the component to just handle the view and not the creation of object as well.
Dependency Injection is the framework / design pattern that allows you to connect a
service to a component.
--------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
Topics to cover today-
1-way data binding & 2-way data binding
Data Binding
	provides the communication between a component and the DOM
	technique used to bind the data from an HTML template to a Component class or vice versa

1-Way Data Binding
	allows us to manipulate the views through the models. Changes in the class are
	reflected in the template.
	-Interpolation or String Interpolation
		{{ data }}
	Property Binding
		img [src]="image" same as String Interpolation- img src = {{ image }}
		From TS to HTML.
		Sets a specific element property.
	Event Binding
		input type="submit" (click)="onSubmit()"
		From HTML to TS.
		Listens for an e lement change event.

2-Way Data Binding
	achieved by combining property binding and event binding together.
		[()]
	[(ngModel)]
		import FormsModule into Angular module
		for data entry forms specifically
			To use the ngModel directive, we need to import the FormsModule package into our
			Angular module.


Angular Directives
	is a marker on a DOM element that tells Angular to change the appearance,
	behavior, and layout of the DOM element and its children. In Angular, most directives
	begin with ng, where ng stands for Angular, and extend the HTML.

Component Directives
	alter the details of how the component should be processed, instantiated, and used at
	runtime.
Structural Directives
	used to manipulate and change the structure of the DOM elements.
	There are three built-in structural directives -
	ngIf,
	ngFor
	ngSwitch

Attribute Directives
	 used to change the look and behavior of the DOM elements.
	 There are two built-in attribute directives -
	 ngClass
	 ngStyle
Custom Directives
	ng generate directive text
Decorators

Component Lifecycle methods

Access Modifiers and variable Types

Single Page Application (SPA)

Angular CLI

Node as JS runtime; npm as a package manager

package.json file

Routing

RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript)
	-framework for reactive programming using observable for writing asynchronous code.
	RxJS subject is special type of observable that allows values to be multicasted to many Observers.



Typescript

Postman

HTTP

JSON

Going up to put O to nap.

</p>
<p>
Back!

This angular documentation is being really helpful-
https://angular.io/guide/built-in-directives#ngModel

Maybe I just lookup all of what we need to study in there??..

npm
Webpack
Single Page Application (SPA)
Package.json file
Typescript
Access modifiers/ variable types
Classes & Decorators
	@Component decorator
	@ngModule decorator
Component lifecycle methods
1-way data binding

<h3>Evening:</h3>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
<p>
Back from lunch.

Make a procedure guide for different tasks and different ways to do.
Based on situations.

Routing
	Default Routing

go to app-routing.module.ts
add path
{ path: '', component : ProductInfoComponent} -> makes this the default
or
{ path : '', redirectTo : 'productInfo', pathMatch : 'full'}


go to product-add.components.ts

add in constructor paren
,public router:Router

go to displayProductInfo()
this.router.navigate(['productList']);

// go to app-routing.modules.ts
-------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
Now for a hands on (40min):

Create links
Add Patients | View Patients

PatientId -
PatientName-
symptom-
billAmount-
doctorAttended-

*required
*billAmount should be between 10000 and 50000

Save patients button
saves into file/json-server

*After saving it should redirect to view all patients
------
DONE
</p>
<p>
back from 20 minute break.

How to delete.
go to product-list.component.html
th Delete
	td button class="btn btn-danger" (click)="removeProduct(product.productId)" Delete

go to product-list.component.ts
successMessage!: string;

under ngOnInit()
removeProduct(productId:number) {
	this.productService.deleteProduct(productId).subscribe((data: any)=> {
		this.successMessage = 'Product with product id '+productId+' deleted successfully';

	}, err => this.errorMessage = err)
}

in html render with
font color="green" h2 {{successMessage}}

------------------------
adding the refresh after delete feature

got to product-list.comp.ts
copy and paste the this.product and paste into new

refreshProducts() {
	this.productService.getProducts().subscribe((data: any) => {
		this.products = data;

	}, err => this.errorMessage = err)
}

add to removeProduct method
this.refreshProducts();

npm install
npm start
json-server --watch productdb.json --id productId


done for the day and all Angular'd up!

</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
Feeling good about the project. Just need to make a few changes.
I'm thinking about doing what I can until training start and then
shifting fully to QC prep.

To do:
-Manager login (just do what I did in bank app)
	add functional  radio button
-Manager functions
	approve or deny
	view all pending
	view all resolved
	view for a specific employee
	view all employees
	-------------------
Training is starting
</p>
<p>
Observable
Promise
Routing
Forms
	Template Driven Forms (TDF)
	Model Driven Forms (MDF)
	Model Driven Forms with Form Builder
Pipes
	Custom Pipes
Javalin
</p>
<p>
Let's add error not being connected to server for user.
go to product.service.ts
	add .pipe(retry(1),catchError(this.errorHandler)) to method getProducts
	add errorHandler method

go to product list
public errorMessage!:string;
	add to constructor, err => this.errorMessage = err)

go to html
font color="red" h1 {{ errorMessage }}

do the same in product info
Got it working on list and info.
Now starting server to check if it goes away.

json-server --watch productdb.json --id productId --port 3000

WORKS
--------------------
</p>
<p>
Now Forms-
Template Driven Forms
create new component
ng g c components/user
create new hyperlink on app.component.html
routerLink user
go to app-routing.module.ts
add path for user UserComponent

create a new component
ng g c components/productAdd

create new component
ng g c components/productCreate

create a hyperlink for each and add routing
Add Product Create Product
--------------------------
</p>
<p>
go to app.modules.ts
import FormsModule if not there

got to user.component.html
h1 Template Driven Forms
form #userForm="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="displayUserDetails(userForm.value)"
div class="form-group"
label
User Id
input type="text" class="form-control" name="userId" [(ngModel)]="userId"
label
User Id
input type="text" class="form-control" name="userName" [(ngModel)]="userName"

input type="submit"

go to user.component.ts
userId!:string
userName!:string

under ngOnInit()
displayUserDetails(values:any){
	console.log(values);
}

Problem with this is you have to take all the values
html to ts
-----------------------------
</p>
<p>
Model Driven Forms aka Reactive Forms
	(most used)
goes directly to

go to product-create.component.ts
productForm!: FormGroup;
in constructor
this.productForm = new FormGroup({
	productId : new FormControl('',Validators.required),
	productName : new FormControl('',Validators.required),
	quanitytOnHand : new FormControl('',Validators.required),
	price : new FormControl('',Validators.required),
})

below ngOnInit()
displayProductInfo(){
	console.log(this.productForm.value)
}

product-create.component.html
form novalidate [formGroup]="productForm" (ngSubmit)="displayProductInfo()"
fieldset
div class="form-group"
label Product Id
input type="text" class="form-control" formControlName="productId"
/div
input type="submit"

go to app-modules.ts
imports :
ReactiveFormsModule
--------------------------
</p>
<p>
CSS Validation keywords
	valid
					invalid
					pristine
						not yet interacted with
	dirty
	touched
		cursor inside
					untouched
we can give messages based on the validation status
go to product-create.component.html
div class="alert alert-danger" *ngIf="productForm.get('productId').hasError('required')
&& productForm.get('productId').dirty" Please enter Product id

go to tsconfig make strict false

Works like a charm.
</p>
<p>
Back from 20 min break.
go to product-create.component.html
after .required
.minLength(5)
.min(0)
.min(1)

go to product-create.component.ts
copy and paste for multiple errors
-------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
MDF w/ FormBuilder

copy and paste

go to product-add.component.ts
productForm!: FormGroup;

inside constructor paren
public formBuilder:FormBuilder
{
	this.productForm = this.formBuilder.group({
		productId:['',Validators.required],
		productName: ['',[Validators.required,Validators.minLength(5)]],
		quantityOnHand: ['',[Validators.required,Validators.min(1)]],
		price: ['',[Validators.required,Validators.min(0)]]
	})
}
move it to ngOnInit()

and displayProtuctInfo()
{
	console.log(this.productForm.value)
}

copy and paste HTML as is.

fixing submit button to be disabled until valid
[disabled]="!productForm.valid"
--------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
Checking if we can save the values into our server.

go to product-add.component.ts
successMessage!: string;
add in constructor parent
,public productService:ProductService

inside displayProductIno()
this.productService.saveProduct(this.productForm.value).subscribe((data:any)=> {
	this.successMessage = 'Product with productid '+this.productForm.value.productId+ ' save successfully'
})

test it out

go to product-add.component.html
font color=green h2{{successMessage}}

WORKS!!! so cool. We are using the methods we created yesterday to
communicate with JSON fake server, which will one day be our real
database. This is power.

###########################################
<h2>17/03/22</h2>
<h3>Evening:</h3>
<p>
4:03 PM right now. Let's finish this project.
Okay I've worked long enough. My eyes are hurting. I need a working manager side
of this and it will be somewhat presentable.
</p>
<p>
I'm on for a minute until family is home.
Let's do this manager login.
</p>
<p>
I'm am exhausted. Added the manager login and now need to fix validation.
Thinking about this logically would be nice, but my brain just doesn't
have the steam to do so. Maybe while sleeping I can figure out if
doesn't take too much time to implement a change.
</p>
<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
<p>
Back let's see how to implement HttpClient in angular.
copied from before lunch-
How to use data from json server and posted in localhost:4200
connect to angular
----------------------------
enable httpmodule in app.module.ts
	imports: HttpClientModule
	add import at top.
	import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http'
go to product.service.ts
add above injectable-
const productURL = "http://localhost:3000/product"
inside constructor paren-
public httpClient:HttpClient
delete harcoded produts
add-
return this.httpClient.get(productURL);

Obeservables (read in revature curriculum)=
can use promises or observables for handling asynchronous data flow

getProducts() : Observable Product [] {
	return this.httpClient.get Product [] (productURL);
}
change in product-info-
this.productService.getProducts().subscribe((data:any) => {
	this.products = data;

});


</p>
<p>
This sets up a connection from json-server/postman to angular UI
We are talking with JSON.

Exercise:
1) create patientsdb.json and hardcode 2 patients information
2) start json-server patientsdb.json
	json-server --watch patientsdb.json --id patientId --port 5678
3) Test all the http methods - GET, PUT, POST, DELETE in postman
	localhost:5678/patient

Computer has zoom frozen and Im going to restart to get it up and running.
</p>
<p>
I'm back. Computer working fine and with different resolution. Not sure I like more.
Anyways here are the steps for connecting  postman to angular from scratch.


0) npm install -g json-server
1) create db.json file with hard coded data
			notepad productdb.json
2) start json-server on port that's not in use
			json-server --watch productdb.json --id productId --port 5678
3) go to postman and make sure it's connected properly and get, put, post, delete working
4) go to angular and enable httpmodule in app.module.ts
5) go to ______.service.ts
6) add const _____URL = "http://localhost:___/___"
7) inside constructor paren add (public httpClient:HttpClient) {}
8) in existing method add get_____() : Observable<____ []> {
	return this .httpClient.get<______ []> (_____URL);
}
9) inside component.ts add this.______Service.get_____().subscribe((data:any) => {
	this.______ = data;

and I think that's it!.

20 min break now.
</p>
<p>
Now we are getting a single product

this.httpClient.get<_____> (`${______URL}/${_____Id}`);

Now we are deleting a product
this.httpClient.delete<_____> (`${_____URL}/${_____Id}`);

Now we are adding a product
this.httpClient.post<_____> (_____URL,_____,this.httpOptions);

We need to do the update method on our own.

--------
</p>
<p>
We want a textbox by which user can search for someone by Id.

create a hyperlink for each component so they dont all appear at once.
Can be achieved through routing.
ROUTING
go to app.component.html
delete all the rendering selectors
a href="" ProductList
a href="" ProductDetails
a href="" PatientList

change above to-
routerLink instead of a href

a routerLink="productList" ProductList
a routerLink="productInfo" ProductInfo

Routing is for navigating from one page to another

app-routing.module.ts

declare the routes in const routes: Routes = [
{ path:'productList', component : ProductListComponent},
{ path:'abc', component : ProductInfoComponent}
];

in app.component.html-
write router-outlet /router-outlet
</p>
<p>
	adding a aboutus and contactus components

	adding to routing

</p>
<p>
Done with training.
--------------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
Morning. Got a morning lift in and starting up the day now.
Training is beginning.

Interviews are coming soon!
Start preparing.

Print out core java assessment test and go over all answers
</p>
<p>
Into Angular again.
Asking question if way we accessed Products yesterday is best way?
with this.products = this.productData.getProducts();

DI/IOC
Dependency Injection / Inversion of Control
mostly SPRING
Angular as well.

to create a service-
ng g s services/product

We are using .services.ts to inject a class into our components rather than
creating new objects for each instance needed.

adding to providers for injectable classes is optional after angular 12

3/17 recording note
20:55 definition of DI
into definition of our stack
What we are learning will make the stack for our P2 and P3.
</p>
<p>
Complete stack includes Angular and Spring
	UI technologies like angular or react to call -> Spring Boot -> DB
	REST webservices is connection from UI(angular) to SpringBoot
	webservice can be REST or SOAP, we use REST.
			tufail is in bengalaru
		expose the method as a webservice as 192.168.1.10 URI
		webservice unites methods across languages
	JSON communicates between applications
		calling over the web is a REST call
	JSON-server is a fake http server

open cmd
npm install -g json-server
move to a drive to create file
notepad productdb.json

entered the data into the file

json-server --watch productdb.json --id productId

Postman
	for testing REST connection

Going on 20 minute break.
</p>
<p>
GET			- retrieve record
PUT			- update
POST		- create/insert
DELETE	- remove

http://localhost:3000/product			-GET		all products
http://localhost:3000/product/7		-GET		single product
http://localhost:3000/product/7		-DELETE	deletes a single product
http://localhost:3000/product/		-POST		add a product
{
	"productId": 299,
	"productName": "Lakme",
	"quantityOnHand": 12,
	"price":
}

200 is okay response
404 is not found

This is really cool. Using HTTP requests to alter json file.
Know this will also work with databases. Feels like superpower too.

test out ADD
POST		raw			JSON
{
	"productId": 299,
	"productName": "Lakme",
	"quantityOnHand": 12,
	"price": 99
}
{
	"productId": 399,
	"productName": "Aroma",
	"quantityOnHand": 199,
	"price": 9600
}

update
localhost:3000/product/71
PUT			raw			JSON
{
	enter updated data
}

using notepad++ we get a notification when changes in file occur.
which is nice.

next week we will create our own URI.

**************************************QC**************************************
what is rest
	Representational State Transfer
	It is a set of rules that developers follow when they create their API.
	architecture, used in web service. 2 types of web services. SOAP and REST API
	you should be able to get  a resource when you link to a specific URL.
	Each URL is called a request while the data sent back is called a response.
********************************************************************************

Showing us another example on amazon.

this link is useful- https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/understanding-using-rest-api/


use case-
we want to display product data from external server

How to use data from json server and posted in localhost:4200
connect to angular
----------------------------
enable httpmodule in app.module.ts
	imports: HttpClientModule
	add import at top.
	import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http'
go to product.service.ts
add above injectable-
const productURL = "http://localhost:3000/product"
inside constructor paren-
public httpClient:HttpClient
delete harcoded products
add-
return this.httpClient.get(productURL);



HttpClient is a service

Back from lunch.

He wants us to practice on our own.
Create
Patient information System

patientId
patientName
symptom
billAmount
doctorAttended

Patient Id		Patient Name		Symptom				Total Bill	Doctor Attended
															(Cold,Cough,Fever)

hard code 7 of them

1) All the details should be in a table
2) Cold patients should be in red color
3) Cough patients should be in blue color
4) Fever patients should be in green color
5) Other patients should be in lime color

component
	patient
model
	patient

First I use ng g class models/patient to create the .ts and .spec.ts
Second I use ng g c components/patient-list to create component


If you have tsconfig.json "strict": set to false then you don't need
to add the ! point when getting that possible null error.
</p>
<p>
Back from a 20 min break.
Looking at routing and Spring

-----------------------------

create a productInfo component

ng g c components/productInfo
for product name and price

paste app-product-info selector in app.component.html

IT IS NOT THE BEST WAY.
let's try creating a class that holds only the data and we pull from.
create in app
create ProductData.ts
	getProducts(){
		return [
			paste array data here
		]
	}
in product-info.component.ts
productData = new ProductData();
this.products = this.productData.getProducts();

in product-list.component.ts
productData = new ProductData();
construtor() {
	this.products = this.productData.getProducts();
}

This is sweet!
Basically same power of Java with more natural flow between html, css, and js.
Feels like having superpowers.

He will update our submission date for P1.

Done training for the day. Will get done lots for the project.

</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
My seed started sprouting yesterday. I was beginning to lose hope.
I planted these when training started and it's nice to see something
else growing in sync. I know O and Y are growing as well in different
ways but this is more of a symbol for my brain and knowledge for
programming. Happy it's working out and hoping I didn't screw it up
by moving the seeds around.

Working through P1. Copying the dislayUserDetails.jsp to an allPending
REimbursements.jsp and changing whats necessary.

Starting class now
</p>
<p>
Today we will cover:
	Directives, binding, decorator, Angular Routing
TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript
	for app scale JavaSCript Development
	from ppt TypeScript_Session01 slide 5

</p>
<p>
type tsc first.ts
and replace first with name of typescript file to compile to js.
then node first
and replace first with name of file.
</p>
<p>
Directives
	Component
	Structural
			*ngFor
			*ngIf
	Attribute
Gives direction to any DOM element

create a new component-
ng g c components/employee
create a class=
ng g class models/employee
creates a .ts and .spec.ts

export class Employee
	employeeId:number=0;
	employeeName:strings=''
	salary:number=0
	designation:string=''

2)
declare object in employee.component.ts
	employee = new Employee();


	constructor() {
		this.employee.employeeId=100;
		this.employee.employeeName="Isha"
		this.employee.salary=67000
		this.employee.designation="HR"
	}

3)
go to employee.component.html

we are creating new project because other one got to clustered
UI - > Spring - > DB

Angular + Spring are a team.

? is forced initialization

He is going super fast. going to take notes here

in html
structured list

*ngFor="let p of products" inside li tag
{{ p.productId }} - {{ p.productName }} - {{ p.quantityOnHand }} - {{ p.price }}

We are hardcoding now but this would normally come from DB.

paste bootstrap in index.html

*********Structural Directives (CHECK THE NAME IS CORRECTs)
=====================
*ngFor="let product of products">
inside the tr tag for create loop until through all products

the covers *ngFor now for *ngIf

tried to implement *ngElse and failed, but hopefully we learn.

[ngSwitch]
in .ts
public color="green";
div [ngSwitch]="color"
	p *ngSwitchCase="'red'">You have selected red
	p *ngSwitchCase="'greed'">You have selected green

My brain is ready for a break.
And now we are. 20 minutes and I'll be back.
</p>
<p>
Back.
nhSyle
div [ngStyle]="{'background-color':'green'}">MY product app

We are doing exercise to see if we can print using his .ts data.
</p>
<p>
Recapping Directives in RevaturePro curriculum
	all Structural directives so far
NEXT QC IS MONDAY.... BRUTAL BUT LET's GET IT
only on Angular


*********What is 1-way binding, event binding, String Interpolation

2-way binding
	(combination of property binding and event binding)
	[]
	()
	[( )] - 2-way binding

in .ts
public guestName:string = "Daniel";

in html
input type="text" [(ngModel)]="guestName"
h1 Welcome {{ guestName }}   example of 1-way binging

Angular modular nature
	creates in portions not as a whole
	to use ngModel you have to enable forms module
	we addded ,FormsModule to app.modules.ts's imports: []

Going on break now for lunch.

<h3>Evening:</h3>
<p>
Been coding for an hour and feeling good about continuing with P1. I
have my login_id foreign key working which is nice.

Now to reprioritize once O wakes up. I'm going to figure if
adding the two tables for employee and manager
or adding a column in users table makes most sense.
Will walk through logic of program to determine.
Then I will create the models for each and create dummy
methods for the tasks they need to be able to do.
Then to build the reimbursements table and make it usable.
A good solid to do list will work wonders and put highest
priorities at the top and work my way down.
I want to know where I stand by 8pm tonight so that's only 2.5
hours away. Get to work.


</p>
<p>
I'm calling it a night on this at 7:24p. A busy and productive day.
On to tomorrow to see where I'm really at.

</p>
<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
<p>
We are back!

npm start

starts bundling process.

FIRST PAGE IN ANGULAR-
http://localhost:4200/

We know how to create component for angular app.
When you create new components you must declare it in app.module.js
add in 'declarations:'
and in bootstrap if it's html

I'm very happy with this experience so far. Learning so much in a
way that I needed. With structure and quality. Hoping this continues for
the last 5 weeks of training.

Another 20 min break
and we are back.

Did a coding challenge and now done. Going to work on P1 all day today
after O goes down for nap.


</p>

<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
Happy pi day. Yesterday wasnt super successful but I'm going to make up
for it with my QC performance. Ignorance is bliss they say.

About to start class. Don't feel 100% but going to go in confident.
Week 7 starting now
core java
sql
css
javascript
selenium
cucumber

code challenge today.
today and tomorrow is the last week of quizes

Angular
	visual studio code
	nodeJS
		17.7.1

JavaScript client side framework
Angular used in Single Page Application

We will use Typscript with Angular that converts it from .ts -> .js

Four main pillars of Angular
	Components
	Services
	Routing
	Directives

About to start a bit amped on coffee. hopefully levels off in the next 15.

5 minute break. I crushed it.
I think most people are trying to memorize smaller details without
fully grasping the core concepts. Like what is DevOps, Agile, AWS,
Log4j, SDLC, Selenium, Cucumber, Gherkin. Know them fully. What they
are for and how they fit in with what we are doing, AND THEN you go
into the details. Sometimes the details unfoil themselves when you
know something fully. Doing the factory, singleton, and prototype
examples in eclipse gave me a better perspective on the details rather
than just memorizing words. You can understand the a factory design pattern
uses a factory class to make a method with a passed in parameter decide on
the object created. Then it becomes obvious that its helpful when you
dont know the particular object to be created until runtime. For prototype
its easier to remember that you use the clonable interface in java when you
have to import it to use it. For singleton it's obvious that you are using a
single instance of a class.

<p>
Download angular dependencies from cmd-
npm install -g @angular/cli

ng new product-app-jwa-us

routing- y
css- enter

Going on lunch break!

Restarting now.
Going to get back on track after O goes to nap

<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
Back and ready. Have 20 minutes till I wake Y up.
Today is daylight saving time. Dumbest invention ever.

Back after saying good morning to Y. She woke up on her own and
got into shower but turned on the stove so water would boil, but me
hearing her awake thought I'd get a few more minutes of studying in, so
her shower was interrupted by having to turn the water off... it's interesting
how we can both be wrong at the same time. I had told her I would
wake her up and enjoy some coffee. She heard that I would make some
coffee and wake her up, neither of which being mutually exclusive.
Case in point. Humans are interesting.

Creating a last study material for this QC tomorrow.
Going up to get O now.

Back in the saddle. Going to work till 12p and put her down for nap.

I'm gettinga little off track as I feel like adding a linux ISO
to sd card and firing up linux on the old laptop that Y gave me.
See if it speeds it up.

<h2>12/03/22</h2>
<h3>Evening:</h3>
<p>
I've just been writing in the morning secition but you can tell
where I got to in there.
I've studied a ton. This is what I have left.
JavaScript, CSS, Logging, AWS.
Will go through the quizlet that covers them when we return from the
store.

Going to do the quizlet now instead of walking to store.

Doing great so far. up to the high 60s out of 110 questions.
Feeling good about my html, css, and javascript knowledge.

I wish the world would use UTC everywhere. Or like roll the dice
on who gets the 0 time base each year at new years so it changes
in some exciting way. I dont think London or whereever it currently is
should retain it in some white technologically dominating way.
Down with the royals and rulers and rule makers for rules sake.

Done with quizlet feeling super brain tired but good!

<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
Up and ready to learn.

Copying and pasting from yesterday as this is most important right now.
Going to complete this so my study material is sectioned out properly.

I'll keep adding notes up here as I work on this. Had gone upstairs
around 6:30am as O was crying but now I am back. 9:46a.

My idea is to watch youtube videos of 4-5 minutes on each subject
to have it in my head. Not sure if this is good idea.

At the same time I will add example code to my learning app.
Yes, it's possible I burn all of my time building what I have to
learn rather than learning it, BUT I want to understand how this
stuff works. I dont want to sit in a QC and guess or blab out
something without knowing how to implement it.

It's eating up a ton of time but I feel a thousand times better
when thinking about creational patterns.
Moving on fromt this now. and have the code in my learning app.
which is cool.

Had to go put O to nap but back now. 12:15p.

Let's keep moving along.

All good on Functional interfaces. Working my way down the list.

Went upstairs to say hi to Yordana before she left at 2pm
It's now 3:37p. I decided to clean the kitchen/stove, and sweep
the floors as well.

Reading about DevOps and Agile now.

Going to do a quick inversion first.
And do 25 minutes on then 3 minute rests to see if that keeps me fresh.

DESIGN PATTERN
	Creational: Singleton Pattern
				design solution where an application wants to have one and only one
				instance of the class
				Ex: Used in logging, caches, thread pools, configuration settings, device driver objects.
				Often used in conjunction with Factor design pattern.
				private static member with instance
				private Constructor
				public static method

			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFo0tj84Abc&list=PLmCsXDGbJHdhULIoYzIIIeFFJSo1NlMbN&index=7
	Creational: Factory Pattern
				we create an object without exposing the creation logic to the
				client and refer to newly created objects using a common interface.
				Basic principle is that at run time we get an object of similar
				type based on the parameter we pass.

		Step implementations
			When Cucumber executes a step in a scenario, it will look for a
			matching step definition to execute. A Step Definition is a small
			piece of code with a pattern attached to it. The pattern is used
			to link the Step Definition to all the matching steps, and the
			code is what Cucumber will execute when it sees a Gherkin step.

	<h2>10/03/22</h2>
 	<h3>Evening:</h3>
 	<p>
	5:40p
	I'm working on the design of the database tables and their relationships.
	If I understand clearly how each table relates to another then I can avoid
	headaches down the line. Another way of doing this is to just keep creating
	tables and dropping them until I have a working model. That's what I did
	last time so I want to test out this other approach to compare.
	</p>
	<p>
	So we have a Users table, a Reimbursement table, and a Login table.
	I wonder if the Users table with an option for Employee and Manager will
	work as good or better than having a seperate table for each. Also, I'm
	still not 100% if a login table is necessary, but I think it's good practice.
	Just not sure about that.
	</p>
	<p>
	For my tables:
	user, login, reimbursement
	a user can have one login and a login can only belong to one user.
	A user can have many reimbursements, but a reimbursement can only belong to
	one user.

	3:25:12 is when he starts to assign things by foreign key. I'll need this
	for JDBC code.

	\i C://Users//Winterfam//Downloads//car-person.sql

	Thats the url I use to download sql file into my database.

	UPDATE person SET car_id = 2 WHERE id = 1;

	So I think I got everything I need from the video for now. stopped at 3:29:33.
	Amazing resource. Here it is if anyone wnats to see.

	Back from lunch-

	Design patterns arent new.
	Singleton
		only one object should be created for a class.
	create new project>
	maven quickstart
	com.training
	design-patterns

	new class
	public class Payment
	with constructor
		"Payment object created"
	public void pay(int amount, String creditor) {
		"USD "+amount +" paid successfully to "+creditor
	}

	go to App.java
	public class App
	in main
	Payment tony = new Payment();
	tony.pay(98000, "Tony");
	Payment amad = new Payment();
	amad.pay(99000, "Amad");
	Payment kami = new Payment();
	kami.pay(99000, "Kami");

	Singleton says only one object should be created.

	create copy of package
	rename to
	com.training.singleton

	go to Payment class-
	Private static Payment payment = null;
	constructor must be private
	create static
	public static Payment getPayment() {

		if(payment == null) {
			payment = new Payment();
		}
		return payment;
	}

	change app.java
	Payment tony = Payment.getPaymentObject();

	*******QC
	How can you create a singleton project?
	Get great definition + example and input here.

	What is an aggregate function in SQL
	Aggregate functions compute a single result from a set of input values.
	An example is using COUNT(*) in a person table to find all the countries
	HAVING COUNT(*) > 40, which means more than 40 people in our table.

	What is scalar functions in SQL?
	Scalar functions are the built-in functions in SQL such as:
	UCASE(), LCASE(), MID(), LENGTH(), ROUND(). Can use on columns
	to have an effect on values returned from query.
	***************************************************
	just used this in my postgreSQL tutorial and could be useful for later
	SELECT ROUND(AVG(price::money::numeric)) from car;

	SELECT make, SUM(price::money::numeric) FROM car GROUP BY make;

	I'm going to skip ahead from 2:03:18 of this video to find the foreign
	key section, which is main thing I'd like help with.
	Jumped ahead to 3:16:42

	I want to get through this section later today and structure my tables.
	Once tables complete I'll create models. Then DAO design and off to the
	races. Remember to take notes for presenting ideas to QC person.
	Figure I can make an interesting automation test for the presentation
	as well. Things needed for that are a wait function to slow it down so
	I can present while it walks itself through... rather than run.
	Main goal is creating a 100% working app. Once I finish that I clearly
	mark it as such in the github repo so I can rollback to working version
	if needed. Then I will begin updating and refining to add features or
	clean up as needed. A non-working cleaner app is 1000% worse than a working
	ugly app. They really dont see the code while I'm presenting. Whether they
	go through after who knows.

	Done for day for training will work on this after we do park with O.

		Very cool how we can log events within our project.
		So basically anytime something happens we can log who did what at
		what time and where specifically.
		We can have username, or any variable shared within the log.
		Kind of scary if you think about if some system is just sharing
		your password in a file on a server somewhere. Do we really trust
		the people that are doing mundane tasks day after day?
		Anyways it's dope. Im going to log everything and can make it a

 	<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
 	<p>
	We are back!

	deleted S3 bucket
	terminated both instances
	stopping RDS and deleting once stopped.

	Talking about JDK1.8 new features
		lambdas expressions
		functional interfaces

		interview question-
		**************
		what is difference between comparable and comparator
		comparable
			java.lang
		comparator
			java.util

		add to the model class-
		implements Comparable<!Product>

	Comparable is nice. Get to customize how we want to compare the getter variable.
	uses compareTo()

	Comparator
	uses compare()

	new class called QOHComparator implements Comparator changed diamond to Product
	if(o1.getQuantityOnHand() > o2.getQuantityOnHand())
		return 1;
	else
		return -1;

		Hands on Create:

		ProductIdComparator

		ProductNameComparator


	lambda expressions-


	back from 20 minute break;
	</p>
	<p>
	Create Employee class
		employeeId
		employeeName
		employeeAddress
		salary

	Store 4 employee records and sort by salary(descending)

	Finished the exercise.

	We are done training for the day. Learned a lot that I think will be
	important for my career. Will try to login later on to get some P1
	complete.

 	<h3>Morning:</h3>
 	<p>
 	After trying in eclipse I think I'll continue with my notes in atom.
	Not being able to control the detached window where it's always in front of my other code
	boxes and minimizing for when I have to share screen is something Im not sure Im okay
	with.

	Also staging and committing in atom is so easy.

	Class starting now.

	Agenda for today, tomorrow, and friday.

	 ###########################################
	 <h2>07/03/22</h2>
	<h3>Evening:</h3>
	<p>
	I'm back for a minute to see if there's anything to sort out
	with the project. I'm upstairs so a bit limited but can still
	make some progress.

	I'm in a position where I can really plan this out effectively.
	Like we have a LoginDAO interface for everything related to
	login. For now that is register and validate/login.
	I use the users table for this at the moment.
	Is there a reason to use a login table like I did before?
	What does that achieve?
	I'll chew on that. It's nice to pass through the user object
	instead of all the variables like I did before.
	Cleaner this way.

	And O wakes up.
	</p>
	<p>
	Back again. 7:52p.


	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
	<p>
	Back!
	Now we are seeing how to use the values passing through.

	DBEAVER
	create table:
	userid - serial
	validateUser - boolean

	we are covering login and logout

	create table user (
		userId serial,
		username varchar(20),
		password varchar(20),
		gender varchar(10),
		notifications varchar(20),
		qualification varchar(20)
	)

	2:00pm on recording

	create a model class that matches the table created
	right click>new class>com.training.ers.model
	User
		private int userId;
		private String username;
		private String password;
		private String gender;
		private String notifications;
		private String qualification;

	generate default constructor, constructor with fields,
	getters and setters, hashcode and equals, toString

	in SignUpController.java servlet

	String finalNotification = "";
	for(String temp:notification) {
		finalNotification += temp +":";
	}
	User user = new User(-1, username, password, gender,
	finalNotification, qualification);

	out.println("You are registered successfully and your password
	is : "+password);

	moved the String finalNotification; to the instance level.
	</p>
	<p>
	---------
	So we now can do array returns as values from user input.
	We are about to enter into Database.

	go to banking app loginDAO
	copy utility and dao packages
	paste into P1
	copy and paste mydb.properties from previous project
	paste into project
	copy and paste dependencies
	postgresql

	refactor name com.training.ers.dao
	only need LoginDAO and LoginDAOImpl

	change LoginDAO
		register(User user)
	Change LoginDAOImpl
		register(User user)

	-------
	tufail going to go through everything again so repeating above
	1) database
	2) dao

	go to SignUpController
	// below saves in database

	LoginDAO loginDAO = new LoginDAOImpl();
	loginDAO.register(user);

	add link after successfully registered for login page
	a href="login.html" Login

	When at SignInController-
	LoginDAO loginDAO = new LoginDAOImpl();

	boolean result = loginDAO.validate(username, password);

	if(result) {
		Welcome +username
	} else {
		your username/password is incorrect , please login again.
		add hyperlink to the login text
	}

	SUCCESSFULLY got a login and signup working for new project
	with Tufail's help. This is huge step for the project.
	Thank you to him for taking time to show as figuring out on
	own would have eaten up a lot of time.
	So cool.
	We have servlets running Java code on webpage using HTML,
	JavaScript, JDBC, postgreSQL, and SQL all together in sync.
	This is smooth
	</p>
	<p>
	Back from a 20 minute break.

	got through some errors people had.
	getting*

	now through. 2:38p

	will get a view example tomorrow.

	create new html files for menus
	on signincontroller.java
	add proceed to your home page
	with a link to welcome.html

	table of reimbursement

	on welcome html page-
	please submit reimbursement details :
	FORM
	name, type, amount,
	with submit input type

	go to DBEAVER
	create table reimbursement (


	)

	Tufail has informed us th QC is not happening tomorrow. But
	I'm going to study this week and get fully ready between P1
	creation.

	This helps a ton but nxt week going to be FULL.

	This is a job and an opportunity. Treat it as such, and you'll
	get everything you can out of it.

	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<h3>Morning:</h3>
	<p>
	Back at it. Rushed morning. I'll blame on daylight saving
	time starting next sunday. My least favorite time of year
	by FAR. If I could get rid of that construct I would.
	Only motivation to get into politics.

	1:1 with Mohammad. He will ask us questions in prep for QC.
	For this week:
	DevOps
	AWS-
	RDS
	Bucket
	Logging
	Lambdas
	Next week- Angular

	We will cover servlets and JSP.
	servlet-
		server side code
		request and response
			create compile and deploy
			tomcat- deploys
	example- maven project that uses servlets to print hello world
	file new>maven project>webapp>com.training - servlets-demo
	build path>configure build path 1.8
	buiild path>configure build path

	Had to create a new server by
	right click in servers>new server
	and then changing build path and running on new server.

	how to create a servlet-
	(server side program)
	right click>new>other>servlet
	java packages- com.training.controller
	class name- WelcomeController
	next
	add- /welcome url mappings
	next
	no changes
	Finish

	change doGet()
	<!--
		PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
		response.setContentType("text/html");

		out.println("<html>");
		out.println<body bgcolor=pink>");
		out.println("<h1>Hello and welcome to my website</h1>");
		out.println("</body></html>");
	-->
	</p>
	<p>
	That's really cool. Running code through servlets.
	This reminds me of something with Django.

	I'm trying to think of ways this is useful.
	While learning it's hard to absorb concepts and connect them
	with their use cases. Like idk how this is different than
	writing the javascript in html.... but maybe just having the
	power of java on a webpage is the whole point?
	webapp is where all html files are. do not create in WEB-INF.

	Why create a servlet vs html
	html is static

	looking at login.html file

	copy login.html and styles.css and paste into webapp

	add link to login to index.jsp

	copy signUp.html and paste into webapp

	apply the css in the head of index.jsp

	copy revlogo.png into webapp

	how to store password from login form

	action="SignInController"
	right click>new>servlet
	com.training.controller
	SignInController

	SignInController.java
	change doGet
	<!--
		PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
		response.setContentType("text/html");
		String uname = request.getParameter("username");
		String pwd = request.getParameter("password");

		out.println("<html>");
		out.println<body bgcolor=pink>");
		out.println("Username :"+uname);
		out.println("Your password is :")+pwd);
		out.println("</body></html>");

		-->
	restart the server to get updated changes
	right click and click clean
	right click server> add and remove

	Back from 20 minutes break.
	</p>
	<p>
	Now to use this for P1 project purposes

	winter-ers-project
	watch at 23:15 in recording Tufail time

	kickstart for P1-
	provide name, password, gender on login

	Write welcome to my ERS with Login and Signup links
	login takes you to login page
	which takes you to ""welcome, name"

	signup takes you to page that shows all details entered
	SignUpController

	Pretty happy I figured that out with setting up login and
	signup with servlets for the project 1 on first go.
	So we are getting the information from the user input,
	which means we can store in an object or do anything with it.
	This is helpful.

	method="get" calls doGet() in servlet
	anything in doGet() will be dislayed in url

	method="post" calls doPost()

	post goes into body portion without appending in URL.

	changed both my login and signup to post instead of GET

	Going on lunch break, back at 12:15p

	Back and slept in today. Go to sleep at 9:15p to get
	back on track.

	I'm planning out my P1 even though we have our QC on Tuesday.
	I give this another 30 minutes and then move on to QC
	studying.
	I have an example setup on excalidraw to give visual
	of the structure of my program. ERS
	Expense Reimbursement System.
	I am also drawing by hand to see how similar and different
	it will be from P0. I can avoid some mistakes I ran into
	with that project.

	So the functionality of this project is very similar to the
	project we just did. Really the only difference I am seeing
	is the connectivity to the webpage so finding how Java and
	Postgresql receive and send data to javascript or
	however that is done. Also the optional requirements will
	really make it stand out so worth going through them in
	beginning before coding to see how they could change the
	structure or we could pivot minorly to allow their room
	for implementation without slowing anything down too much.
	I don't want to bite off more than I can chew, but I also
	know how it feels to "finish" early. Feel like there's
	nothing else to do WHEN clearly there was lots more to do
	and I just couldnt see it. Dont do that again.

	Just found some quizlet study decks that will be good.
	I deleted some topics off of it that we havent
	got to yet, but sharing with batch mates now.
	https://quizlet.com/_b73tp3?x=1qqt&i=477pnb

	We are back. Working with cucumber in selenium tests.
	---------------------
	QC on Tuesday. This one I am doing perfect on.
	1pm PT
	****
	Javascript
	Selenium
	Cucumber
	Gherkin
	WebDriver Setup
	POM
	PageFactoy
	HTML
	CSS
	****
	---------------------
	What is POM (Project Object Model)-
	Design pattern to create object repository
	A class is create for each page to identify..
	the web elements of that page and also can contain action.
	Seperates tets objects and test scripts.
	For reusability and readability.

	create class LoginPAge inside package com.training.pages
	in selenium-cucumber

	WebDriver driver;
	By txt_username = By.id("name");
	By txt_password = By.id("password");
	By btn_login = By.id("login");
	By btn_logout = By.id("logout");

	create default constructor-
	public LoginPage(WebDriver driver)
		{
		this.driver = driver;
		}

	public void enterUsername(String username) {
		driver.findElement(txt_username).sendKeys(username);
	}
	public void enterPassword(String password) {

	Selenium inbuilt POM
	@FindBy

	initElements

	Now we are on to tags after a 20 minute break.
	</p>
	<p>
	They can be custom like
	@googletest
	@testproject
	@logintest

	in the TestRunner.java file you add a ,
	after the @cucumberOptions plugin {}
	and add the @ symbol for tests you want to run.

	My computer is overheating and zoom isnt responding going
	to restart eclipse first then zoom if needed.

	This concludes selenium and cucumber for now.

	done class. will be on later.

	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<h3>Morning:</h3>
	<p>
	Starting now!

	Back into cucumber

	Got my cucumber test running for the saucedemo.
	Something about this is very cool.

	Back from a 20 minutes break.

	</p>
	<p>
	So we are learning a lot of testing. This could be
	what I will be doing for foreseeable future.
	Find lasting ways to learn and remember
	everything important.

	Hot to generate test reports in different formats.
	Don't just try to understand for right now.
	How to quickly navigate to these answers when
	I need them.

	Some things I will learn by brute force repition.
	Some things are more specific to situations.
	File resources as such. Scenario based.

	I guess this training is sort of like a fire-hose
	of information and just trying my best to figure
	out on the fly what is going to be the most
	important things we are experiencing, but the
	biggest part is just surviving and trusting their
	system to mold me into the full stack software
	developer they aim for me to become. I did not
	start this process because I knew how to do that

	DOM Manipulation

	We will add option for souse on signup

	After qualification add tr and td
	"Enter spouse details" name="SpouseName" id="spouseName"
	add button value="Married"

	onClick="addDynamicControls()">

	function addDynamicControls() {

	var newInput = document
	}

	He is changing the html through javascript.

	Steps:
	add div id ="myDiv1"

	var mainDiv = document.getElementById('myDiv1');

	var newTextBox = document.createElement('input');
	newTextBox.type = 'text';
	newTextBox.setAttribute('id', 'username');
	marriedButton.innerText = "Spouse name : "
	mainDiv.append(newTextBox)

	<h3>Evening:</h3>

	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
	<p>
	I'm back from lunch. Forgot to push the diary before I went on break. Feeling good about the project.
	What do I fix next?
	Let's run some tests-
	Getting my feet wet with this. Think I have the register test working... somewhat at least.

	Okay nevermind not working as needed. Having trouble testing the register as it actually registers
	a user. And then when I try to bring over the delete user method from employeeDAOImpl it doesn't
	work the way Id expect. I'm sure it's something easy I'm not seeing.

	Went down a rabbit hole with adding Tufail's procedure that supplies the updated balances for sender
	and receiver from database. Got it working.

	The tests weren't so easy so that's what I'll smooth out between now and tomorrow morning.

	Training is done for the day. Feel good about it. could have been more productive but also got a lot of
	little things done as I figured out what was needed.


	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<h3>Morning:</h3>
	<p>
	Good morning. the orange seeds have not sprouted yet, but I know they will.
	</p>
	<p>
	What are the things I still need to do:
	</p>
	<p>
	1) As an employee I am alerted how many new account applications there are.
	AND then I can approve or deny each one.
	</p>
	<p>
	2) As employee I can view all account froms a customer.
	</p>
	<p>
	3) Change the view balance option to let user select which account of theirs to view.
	</p>
	<p>
	4) Chance the make withdraw or deposit to let user select which account of theirs to use
	</p>
	<p>
	5) REFUSE withdrawing or depositing a negative amount.
	</p>
	<p>
	I'm going to start with completing the approveApply and deleteApply methods in EmployeeDAOImpl.
	approve will take the values of the apply table and insert applicable values into customers table.
	delete will delete the values from the apply table.
	</p>
	<p>
	Reject application is working great. Next will be the approve function.
	Feel like Im getting a better and better grasp on all of this and how everything works together.
	I get into moments of having no idea but get out of those moments faster and faster.

	</p>
	<p>

	Class is starting now.
	Tufail is showing us how to get the updated balances from a debit and credit transfer in dbeaver.
	transferAmountAndGetBalance(?,?,?,?,?)
	stat.execute()
	</p>
	<p>
	Now we are going over the specifications again.
	Tufail says one account per customer
	change congrats your account opened to
	congrats your account got opened and is pending approval.
	wont be able to sign in just yet. change login table to happening with approveApply method
	login will check the login table first for username and password and then the apply table.
	</p>
	<p>
	menu for approve/deny
	</p>
	<p>
	1.view all pending approval
	list of pending approvals
	press the number to aprove or deny
	Y/N (Y to approve and N to deny)
	Y
	_____ account successfully opened
	N
	______ account not approved.

	Tufail wants a status column
	default is N
	change to Y when approved by employee
	</p>
	<p>
	--------------------------------------------
	</p>
	<p>
	Trying to think of what the benefits vs negatives are of having that column with N or Y vs diff table.
	Benefit of apply table is that I can print easily.... is this true?
	Negative is that I have to do 2 seperate queries for checking if they arent in the customers table.
	Going to repost from above what I still have to do-
	</p>
	<p>
	1) As an employee I am alerted how many new account applications there are.
	AND then I can approve or deny each one.
	</p>
	<p>
	2) As employee I can view all account froms a customer.
	</p>
	<p>
	3) Change the view balance option to let user select which account of theirs to view.
	</p>
	<p>
	4) Chance the make withdraw or deposit to let user select which account of theirs to use
	</p>
	<p>
	5) REFUSE withdrawing or depositing a negative amount.

	I'm going to go with Tufail's idea and drop the extra table.

	So I've changed create user and login to reflect the updated customers table.
	Now to update the approval process.

	So now the approve and reject functions are working on a basic level.
	Have to fix so that the employee doesn't accidentally delete a different user than one he intends to.
	but that can come later.

	So now I am done with 1) shown above.
	AND 2)
	and 3)
	and 4)

	think it's just # 5 from the above options.. I need to re evaluate with these new changes and see
	what I broke in the update process.

	Looks like everything is working so far. I'll write a few JUnit tests to be sure.
	Then I'll see what this Log4j is all about. Feel like its going to be super simple read and write to file
	on local system.

	maybe i need to add functionality to customer account to ACCEPT a transaction from another account
	but based on tufails go over of the details I don't think this is required.

	I took a look at log4j, think I can get it up and running with a tutorial or two and 3-4 hours.

	Let's hold off on log4j for a bit. It's to be done when everything else is locked.
	What is next?

	refuse the negative amount withdraw or deposit.

	Okay that is fixed now too.... I'm just moving through this faster than I thought I would.

	<h3>Evening:</h3>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
	<p>
	 1:11p
	 Back after putting O to nap.
	 Let's setup real boundaries for sending a transfer.

	 Cleaned up the DAOs. Getting better idea of how each actually works.
	 A lot of grabbing from the product app actually creates more confusion when you are trying to debug.
	 But it definitely helped to guide me along. Okay back to fixing those transfer to account issues.
	 Fixed!

	 Okay what next??

	 I might switch things around a bit. From reading this again I'm thinking that once a user signs
	 into the customer menu they should have an option for applying for an account.
	 Which means that they would apply and then have to wait for an employee to approve.

	 This means that I must remove the unique constraint to the username in customers table.

	 It also means the apply for account will send values to a Staging area until APPROVED by employee.
	 Which will then move it to the official customers table.

	 So with creating multiple accounts for users we need to differentiate the rows by userid for same username
	 then we can populate for employee by username.
	 And when making transfer or withdraw or deposit we have to use the userid.
	 Think this makes sense.

	 Okay so the apply table worked for sending an account application in.
	 Now I need to go through an an employee and have the system tell me if there are any pending applications.
	 If yes then I can accept or delete them.

	 Finished the view balance requirement real quick.
	 To make it work for other accounts under same username I will have to show other userid's that match username.
	 I'm a bit worried now that other people can register with the same username... but I don't think its possible.
	 As long as I make the create account process protect from this then I don't have to worry about
	 protecting at the database level.
	 Just checked... looks safe unless someone really wanted to attack this.

	 Now to do the employee side of accepting an account application.

	 So I AM READY FOR A BREAK.

	 Basically got the approve or reject function working just have to add the final detail to the employeeDAOImpl
	 so that I write out for it to approve or deny... which sounds like I did nothing . but not true.

	 Things are moving fast!




	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<h3>Morning:</h3>
	<p>
	5:31a and ready. Let's put some work in.
	And now its 6:01a and havent done anything... why!

	I've changed the loginDAO functions over to customer dao. lets see if they work.
	Works! Create acconnt, login to customer or employeee, Withdraw, deposit, and transfer work great.
	Next:
	maybe I should change balance from int to something that handles larger numbers?
	So I changed them to long.
	I need to remmeber how much time and energy it takes to do small things that pop up.
	They can kill me when I have a deadline. Which I do.
	Let's prioritize.

	Let's do the transaction table real quick. 7:32am - 20 minutes estimate

	Okay transaction table is working. I was pretty spot on with guessing time it would take. Maybe
	a little ambitious. Will add 5 minutes on estimate from here on. 7:57a

	I need to create function for employee to view all transactions.. Should basically be a copy
	of the print all products from the product alstrom app we worked on. Going to say good morning to the
	family first.

	Back at the computer. 9:14a.
	Family is good. They are going to the beach. Feel like I could join, but want to be sure I have this
	project ready to go. Don't want to guess on it. The priority is my family and through successfully
	getting a software engineering job I will fulfill the security aspect of providing how I can.

	So I have the transacations posting from withdraw, deposit, and transfer to the transaction table.
	Now I need to have the ability for employee to see all transactions. Basically the whole table.

	I have the see all transactions in the employee side working. That was easier than I thought it would be.
	Although it does something funky where in nulls the sender instead of the receiver which I thought
	would be the opposite... but still works!

	Now on my list what I have left:

	CUSTOMER-
	view the balance of a specific account
	accept a money transfer from another account

	EMPLOYEE-
	Approve or reject an account
	View a customer bank accounts

	1 JUnit test

	So the program is a mess right now.
	I was tring to figure out the delete user function.
	Which led me to attempting to print all users.
	Going to work backwards from there to see whats wrong.

	I have no idea. Im restarting eclipse.

	So restarting it and deleting the test class fixed it. Maybe it overloaded with requests to SQL
	and needed to clear itself out.. who knows.

	So I needed to add the con = DBConnection.getConnection(); to each transaction method because I had
	left the connection open previously but must have run out of whatever the limit was.

	something to add to list. The transaction goes through no matter what even if recipient doesnt exist.

	Okay taking a break. Got a lot done so far.




	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>

	</p>

<h2>26/02/22</h2>
<h3>Evening:</h3>
<p>
5:30p and I haven't dont much that I wanted to.
Got the windows activation fixed on my mac which is nice.
But thats more of a nice to have then need to have.
Now lets do some work.
What needs to be fixed? Going to push to git now. Just because.

Okay Im running in circles here but learning at the same time.
I realized I need to return the object from the method to have the database values stored in object.
But now Im wondering if the boolean was more important... feels stupid to ask because I can handle
easily to determine in the BankApp.java if the object was returned with nulls... but that's not the
point of a validate method. So how to have a validate method ONLY validate and run a get values from
database method that runs after its confirmed as valid... not sure if this is best but I'm going with it.


Now I'm really moving. Just moved the getting values from database into object functionality into a
method from the customerDAO rather than the LoginDAO. More of preference than anything but Im
understanding this more and more as I go along.
So it works!
I am now able to login, register, transfer funds, deposit to another specific account, withdraw,
adding deposit to account now.

I'm feeling 10,000% better than when I started an hour ago. The app is really working.
I need to add conditions all over the place. But the skeleton is holding itself up.
I'm not 100% sure on the tables just yet.
I think the login table will be strictly for gathering all users who can log in's username and password.
Maybe the customer_id and employee_id if it makes sense, but that's not clear to me.
If it has the username and password then that will be enough for now.
Then the customer table has userid, firstname, username, password, balance, accounttype.
Not even sure if accounttype really matters to be stored.
The employee table could be the same... does it need a balance? Maybe the same without a balance and accounttype
as that is more obvious... well it's obvious for both but I can use that value for further validation
possibly.

So I'm am flying through this. Crazy how many tangles you have to clean up as you figure one thing out.
I have the create customer and create employee working well. Once a customer or employee is successfully
registered they are inside the database.

Okay it's piecing together more and more. I see that I am building out the employee side of this.
I'll also need the table to log all transactions so an employee can view when they want to.

OK i am ready to leave it there. Tomorrow I do more:
I need to move the withdrawFromAccount and transferFromAccount over to the CustomerDAO.
Create the Employee functionality.
Create the transactions table.
WOOOOOOO!


</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>In the seat. Can work until 9am then have a workshop to attend.

Reminder. 2/17 n and 2/16 a

on 2/16 3:26 mark / 11:56 tufails time is how to import tables into postgres.

Jumping into project now. Hope to resolve where I left off.

I'm going to stop down on coding to think this through logically.
I'm worried that I can barrel through and create a working app despite
choosing bad practices. How do I know what is better?
I am learning what I don't know by just continuing on.
Is the point to learn as I hit these moments and keep reevaluating rather than
get into a state of paralysis? Maybe I can meet somewhere half way..
Like keep going. Stop and think for 30 minutes on what I am doing.
Then continue. Is this artificial reflection just to reduce doubt?
Is it even necessary?
Is the whole point just to create a working app no matter what?
Deciding on best practices without having experience to know better might be foolish.
Maybe its a bad practice to even worry about it.
Despite all of this. I know that I must learn how to create an instance of an object,
store the user input into its values to go to postgres database. Locate the full row
of values. Store ALL of the values in the object and return that object back to
java through jdbc. Right now I can do validation and insertion.. how to take?
</p>
<p>
What specifically am I trying to solve now?
</p>
<p>
^This is more important than any of the BS above it. Where am I know?
So a user can "login" which means the username and password they enter is validated as matching
the username and password combo stored in the database. As long as that username
variable stays as it is then we can identify someone as logged in.
We can then use that username to: view the balance of a specific account,
make transactions only from that account that is logged in to specific accounts,
withdraw from only that account,
deposit to only that account,
and accept a money transfer from another account.
This will define a customer account.

Once I complete all of the above then I move on to employee accounts-
approve or reject an account,
view any customers bank account,
view a log of all transactions.

Add a JUnit test

If I finish all of the above I will be happy.
Optional:
Log4j is implemented to log events to a file.

Okay enough thinking. I'll do the workshop and come back to this asap.

	my own when in Philly back in December. Now revisiting.</p>

<p>I'm pulling this into eclipse and seeing if it makes more sense
	rather than having two IDEs.... but as I'm writing this I realized it
	wont work because it pushes my Eclipse over the zoom video that I use
	to watch Tufail's screen as he teaches us. So that was a quick no. Will
	stick with ATOM for note taking unless I add another monitor in here
	and can have Tufail's screen on one. My code on another and then a 3rd
	screen for browser/notes/chat. But now Im thinking I do the TV for just
	the Zoom video and my computer for the coding... Trying to think why
	this wouldnt work. Going to give it a try for a bit. I do really like
	the integration that atom has with GIT and github. Wonder if eclipse
	has it as well. In order to see updates on atom code I just have to hit
	save on eclipse. But to see it in eclipse I have to close and reopen.</p>
<p>AWS is all setup for next week. Back into JavaScript learning.

	JavaScript functions built in functions Javascript is sweet. powerful
	in a tiny punch. Can see how useful it will be with databases for user
	interfaces. We just blazed through alert(), parseInt(), confirm(),
	functions, and onclick. Tufail says to always open the console in
	browser when typing in javascript. That's how to check errors as they
	happen.</p>
<p>String methods: toLowerCase() toUpperCase() slice() charAt() I
	tested a few out with his hands on example. Math methods: sin(x) cos(x)
	tan(x) floor(x) Math.pow() Math.random()</p>
<p>Can use constructors in javascript We went on a 20 minute break.
	back now and working with javascript. Feels nice being back.</p>
Variable scope- local vs global if you don't put var before declaring
variable it can be called in other function as long as its function was
called in that function. hoisted is when declared variable is moved to
top of code. **** QC What is variable scope in javascript? lexical scope
hoisting function scope local scope global scope javascript standards
let keyword const keyword == vs === double checks value triple check
strict type datatypes type coercion explicit Number('3'), String(123),
Boolean(2) implicit '3' * '2', 2 Arrow functions =>

<p>Make arrow function that takes 3 numbers and returns the largest
	one functions self invoking anonymous function selectors closers Off to
	lunch.</p>
<p>Back. We are looking at Object Hierarchy in Javascript. window is
	at the top. Take a look at this and become familiar- (not sure this is
	imp) We have done all internal javascript up to now. Now for external.

	add src="script.js" to the html file inside script tag. inline is when
	you add the function to occur inside the input type area. now we are
	done with javascript We did a test for SQL that I did well on.</p>
<p>Now we are in individual breakout rooms working on project zero.
	Back in driver seat. I just crunched through and got my transfer
	function working. So now I have withdraw from account and transfer from
	one account to another working. I need to tinker with them to make them
	beautiful but I'm very happy with my progress so far. Think I've been
	leaning on my wrist too much because it feels slightly bruised. Will
	have to be conscious of this going forward. Anyways I'm excited.
	Basically I need to add: System- Reject transfers that might cause
	senders account to go below zero make sure accounts cant go below zero.
	Reject withdraw or deposit that results in negative balance Customer-
	Add a deposit to account function. View balance of a specific account
	Function to accept money transfer from another account ?Is there a
	staging area for transfers? Employee: approve or reject an account
	?maybe this is just leave alone or delete? unless I have staging area.
	view a customers bank accounts ?does this mean a user can have more
	than one account? view a log of all transactions table of ALL
	transactions ever</p>

<h3>Evening:</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
<p>
	I'm back. JavaScript- What is a client side message? vs server side

	**** javascript is for: making webpages more interactive, client side
	validations, etc. to generate html dynamically to handle html element
	events create html file for javaScript

	<!--script type="text/javascript"-->

	right click and inspect to check for errors official name is -
	ECMAScript back from taking a minute with Y. Now we are working on
	Pzero Will real-time update. Going to leave it here for now as I want
	to be with yordana for a few moments. Great day of learning. Best to
	remember I need to fix the withdrawal function. Something to do with
	the userid not sending through properly.

</p>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>Going to try with flipping the times of day. Think it makes more
	sense. Good morning btw. 5:19a Been working straight through to 6:27.
	Going to take a break for a moment. Got my login and customer tables
	working together so they update at same time on register. Things are
	working out. **** Reminder to finish the coding quiz before tomorrow
	evening. On revaturepro. And class begins! jdbc- callable statements
	css CallableStatement used to call stored procedure Procedure is like a
	function but can return multiple values select * from product; CREATE
	OR REPLACE FUNCTION totalRecords() RETURNS integer AS $total$ declare
	total integer; BEGIN SELECT count(*) into total FROM product; RETURN
	total; END; $total$ LANGUAGE plpgsql; --call function select
	totalRecords(); ------------Procedure create or replace procedure
	transfer( sender int, receiver int, amount dec ) language plpgsql as $$
	begin --subtract from sender update accounts set balance - balance -
	amount where id = sender; == adding to receiver update accounts set
	balance = balance + amount where id = receiver; commit; end;$$ ---call
	procedure call transfer(1,2,2000); select * from accounts; Mohammad
	showed us how to create procedure in postgres Now we are learning how
	to call it in jdbc create class in jdbc_demos
	CallingProcedureFromJava.java main Scanner scanner = new
	Scanner(System.in); System.out.println("Enter the account number to
	debit the amount :"); int sender = scanner.nextInt();

	System.out.println("Enter the account number to credit the amount :");
	int reciever = scanner.nextInt(); System.out.println("Enter the ammount
	to be transfered :"); int amount = scanner.nextInt(); Connection
	connection = DBConnection.getConnection(); CallableStatement stat =
	connection.prepareCall("call transfer(?,?,?)") stat.setInt(1,sender);
	stat.setInt(2,reciever); stat.setInt(3,amount); stat.execute();

	System.out.println("Transfer done/completed"); **** WHAT IS THE USE OF
	CALLABLE STATEMENT? is an interface by which we can make a call to a
	procedure from our jdbc This is really useful too. now we are on to
	html, css, and javascript HTML hyper text markup language used for
	creating webpages markup language because it uses tags Mohammad is a
	memory Doctor the html page we created is just a page what is CSS and
	what is javascript? selector is element to be styled So far so good. I
	sort of hope we never have to dive to far into CSS, but I'm comfortable
	with the basics. Design just never feels that interesting to me. More
	into how things work and functionality. Let's see if I agree with that
	in 10 years. internal css external CSS create new file > name
	styles.css (but can be anything.css) copy and paste from internal to
	this file. write in individual .html files- <;link type="text/css"
	rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> just added background image to all
	pages on website. SQL and java are so much more interesting to me. how
	can I make this more interesting? Like making a database work is
	fascinating but making it pretty for a user isn't so thrilling. DOM is
	document object model inline css **** QC What is difference between
	Inline and Block Elements Inline is when it renders within the line
	itself span Block elements create a new line div, p, br, onto a 20
	minute break now. We are back 9:37a Cascading Style Sheets for styling
	HTML documents composed of: selectors HTML element like h3, h1, p
	declarations comprised of a property and a value surround by curly
	braces css properties border padding margin display position color
	text-align now we are creating classes in css written in style element
	with . before like .mycolor {} I just need to know how this will apply
	to our potential job to make the connection in my mind now we have a
	usecase: // doesnt seem like we are on this yet id attribute to specify
	style p#p1{ color: fuchsia; } classes are to be used exclusively with
	dot notation css selectors element id class universal attribute **** QC
	question- What are different types of css selectors element id class
	universal attribute grouping child Now on to lunch for an hour.</p>

<h2>23/02/22</h2>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
	5:47am and I'm ready to go. Last night I changed the menu option for
	banking app to reflect what Mohammad has. It doesn't make sense to
	provide options for withdrawl and deposit / transfer before someone has
	logged in. I've now switched over the variable accountName to username
	to match what I need for loggin in on BankDAO and BankDAOImpl. Now I'm
	modifying AddAccount method and checking the status of table with
	printAllAccount method. So I successfully add the add account function
	to my app, but that was for a test users table. Now I have to switch it
	over to the respective Employees and Customers tables depending on
	which they are. Class is starting now. <br /> <br /> Need to have
	clearer things to study after each day and load it into the
	learning-app. Like yesterday I took notes all day but dont have clear
	idea on what would be asked on QCs that needs to change. <br /> <br />
	**** JDBC terms and core concepts are important DAO - Data access
	Object Interfaces of JDBC **** <br /> <br /> Design Pattern Reusable
	solutions to common software development problems We use the DAO design
	pattern in our banking app to seperate the problem domain from the
	persistence mechanism. Uses interfaces to define an abstraction <br />
	<br /> We are taking some time to read about DAO Design Pattern here <a
		href="https://app.revature.com/curriculum/12767/batch/1211/viewCalendar">2/21</a>
	From my understanding it seperates the methods into an interface from
	the concrete class that accesses the database. Which allows you to
	switch out that concrete class for a different database if needed or
	whatever way you are accessing the data. <br /> <br /> Now we will
	create the delete function in project. Actually he wants to talk about
	statement and prepared statement **** QC Question! ^ <br /> <br />
	Now to delete copy and paste the update code in ProductDAOImpl "delete
	from product where productId =?") statement.setInt(1, productId); <br />
	<br /> (rows + " deleted successfully") <br /> <br /> then
	ProductApp case 2: productId = scanner.nextInt();
	productDAO.deleteProduct(productId); break; <br /> <br /> If you try
	to delete a product that isn't there you should handle that. If you try
	to update a product that isnt there you should handle at the moment
	entered. ^ create a method if product exists in ProductDAO.java public
	boolean isProductExists(int productId); <br /> <br /> copy code from
	searchProductByName to isProductExists <br /> <br /> public boolean
	isProductExists(int productId) { boolean productExists = false;
	PreparedStatement stat; try{ stat = con.prepareStatement("select * from
	product where productId = ? "); stat.setInt(1, productId); ResultSet
	res = stat.executeQuery(); productExists = res.next(); } catch
	(SQLException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } return productExists; } <br />
	<br /> now we will use JUnit testing to see if method works as we
	hope. <br /> <br /> write test case- <br /> <br /> right click on
	DAOImpl create new>Test Case configure for 1.8 <br /> <br /> he's
	going really fast through this so someone will ask him to do it again-
	<br /> <br /> ProductDAO productDAO; @Afterall <br /> <br />
	@BeforeEach void setUp() throws Exception { productDAO = new
	ProductDAOImpl(); } @Test @DisplayName("Testing product exists-1") void
	testIsProductExists() { int productID=2; boolean actual =
	productDAO.isProductExists(productId); assertTrue(actual); <br /> <br />
	@Test @DisplayName("Testing product exists-2") void
	testIsProductExists2() { int productID=2827; boolean actual =
	productDAO.isProductExists(productId); assertFalse(actual); } <br /> <br />
	@Test @DisplayName("Testing product exists-3") void
	testIsProductExists4() { int productID=20827; boolean actual =
	productDAO.isProductExists(productId); assertFalse(actual); } <br /> <br />
	That was tough to keep up with but I got through and can replicate for
	my own test cases in the bank app. Adding that now and will do delete
	if there's extra time. <br /> <br /> we cant test a method that is
	void. (i think) so we are changing our methods to return something.
	public boolean addProduct public boolean updateProduct public Product
	searchByProductId public List<;Product> searchByProductName public
	List<;Product> searchProductByPrice public List<;Product>
	getProducts(); (without semi colons above) public boolean
	isProductExists <br /> <br /> change for each in ProductDAOImpl
	initialize row=0 take away initialization at int rows =
	statement.executeUpdate(); <br /> <br /> if(rows==0) return false;
	else return true; <br /> <br /> he is adding them to codeshare for
	us-
	<ahref"https://codeshare.io/tufail">here</a> <br />
	<br />
	he is changing the searchByProductName code <br />
	<br />
	List<;Product> products = new ArrayList<;Product>(); PreparedStatement
	stat' try{ stat = connection.prepareStatement("select * from product
	where productName like ? ") stat.setString(1, productName); <br />
	<br />
	ResultSet res = stat.executeQuery(); while(res.next()) { Product
	product = new Product(); product.setProductId(res.getInt(1));
	product.setProductName(res.getString(2));
	product.setQuantityOnHand(res.getInt(3));
	product.setPrice(res.getInt(4)); products.add(product); } } catch
	(SQLException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } return products <br />
	<br />
	now we change printAllProducts to public void getProducts() { } <br />
	<br />
	change getProducts and searchProductsByPrice <br />
	<br />
	going to 17 minute break and back at 9:35a <br />
	<br />
	back from break and mohammad is flying. <br />
	<br />
	I'm caught up now he is adding test cases for all methods- <br />
	<br />
	@TestMethodOrder(value = MethodOrderer.OrderAnnotation.class) <br />
	<br />
	ProductDAO productDAO int productId; Product product; <br />
	<br />
	@BeforeEach void setUp() throws Exception { productDAO = new
	ProductDAOImpl(); productId = 9999; product = new Product(); } <br />
	<br />
	@Test @Order(value = 1) void testAddProduct() { Product product = new
	Product(productId, "Dummy", 10, 100);
	assertTrue(productDAO.addProduct(product)); } <br />
	<br />
	@Test @Order(value = 2) void testSearchByProductId() { Product
	foundProduct = productDAO.searchByProductId(productId); product = new
	Product(productId, "Dummy", 10, 100); assertEquals(foundProduct,
	product); } <br />
	<br />
	@Test @Order(value = 3) void testUpdateProduct() { Product
	updatedProduct = new Product(productId, "NewDummy", 199, 90);
	productDAO.updateProduct(updatedProduct);
	assertTrue(productDAO.updateProduct(updatedProduct)); } <br />
	<br />
	@Test @Order(value = 4) void testGetProducts() { List<;Product>
	products = productDAO.getProducts(); assertNotEquals(0,
	products.size()); } <br />
	<br />
	@Test @Order(value = 5) void testDeleteProduct() {
	assertTrue(productDAO.deleteProduct(productId)); } <br />
	<br />
	go to DAOImpl <br />
	<br />
	searchProductById <br />
	<br />
	He is adding test code and Impl code to codeshare now. <br />
	<br />
	finish updating tests we went through together and finish the final 3
	that we didn't. <br />
	<br />
</p>
<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
<p>

	Back from lunch All functions working properly and all tests. <br /> <br />
	Now we got to ProductApp.java and make sure all working there. <br />
	<br /> case 1: if(productDAO.isProductExists(productId)) {
	System.out.printlin("Product with product id : "+productId+" already
	exists, please try with another product id"); continue; } <br /> <br />
	result = productDAO.addProduct(product); if(result) {
	System.out.println("Congratulations, your product....") } else { "Sorry
	your product cannot be saved" } <br /> <br /> case 2:
	if(productDAO.isProductExists(productId)) {
	productDAO.deleteProduct(productId); "product deleted successfully"; }
	else { "product with product id : "+productId+" does not exist, hence
	it cannot be deleted." } <br /> <br /> case 3:
	if(!productDAO.isProductExists(productId)) { "product does not exist so
	could not be updated"; continue; }
	-------------------------------------------------------------- declare
	at top of ProductApp List<;Product> products = <br /> <br /> for case
	5: products = productDaO.searchByProductName(productName);
	printProductDetails(products); <br /> <br /> case 6: products =
	productDAO.getProducts(); printProductDetails(products); <br /> <br />
	case 7: <br /> <br /> products =
	productDAO.searchProductByPrice(lower,upper); <br /> <br />
	printProductDetails(products); break; <br /> <br /> outside the while
	loop and start product app <br /> <br /> public void
	printProductDetails(List<;Product> products) { Iterator<;Product>
	iterator = products.iterator(); while(iterator.hasNext()) { Product
	temp = iterator.next(); System.out.println(temp); } } <br /> <br />
	need to fix search by name to say "___ does not exist" if item does not
	exist if(products.size()==0) { System.out.println("No products matching
	your criteria"); continue; } <br /> <br /> case 4: <br /> <br />
	copy code from delete code <br /> <br /> if
	(productDAO.isProductExists(productId)) { Product temp =
	productDAO.searchByProductId(productId); System.out.println(temp); } <br />
	<br /> So I think this project is basically fully functional. <br />
	<br /> All the menu items work, all the methods work, a few test
	cases. Need to finish this. But overall it was great building from
	scratch with Mohammad. He says log4j is optional for p zero but I
	really want to have it working. My plan is to have the full project
	done on Saturday. Code locked by Sunday morning. And then practice
	presenting it on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. <br /> <br /> Mohammad
	is dropping knowledge on the project for login and validate. rewatch
	recording at 2:50am his time. 1:25p my time. <br /> <br />
	while(true) { 1. add user 2. login "please enter your choice" choice =
	scanner.nextInt(); <br /> <br /> switch } <br /> <br /> On a 20
	minute break now. Mohammad just went into super hyper drive with what
	he shared. Everything super useful for our projects. I don't feel
	worried about anything now. Just have to put in the time. <br /> <br />
	I'm jumping back in early to start taking more chunks out of this
	project. <br /> <br /> I'm hungry for it. <br /> <br /> So I got
	all the way through the Login build out to validating a user login. I
	will rewatch the video to follow that along. Really nice of him to
	provide that to us. Will not take for granted. Okay back into training.
	I'm so excited to do this on my own later. Future apologies to my wife
	and kids but this is so dope. <br /> <br /> sql and jdbc quiz- open
	for 2 days <br /> <br /> hands on for right now: <br /> <br /> if
	you choose 1: please enter username: please enter password: <br /> <br />
	congrats you are registered <br /> <br /> then return to main menu <br />
	<br /> please enter username: please enter password: <br /> <br />
	if correct- welcome, joseph <br /> <br /> product app menu <br /> <br />
	my login isnt working correctly I will have to debug later <br /> <br />
	He says to add a logout option to the menu once logged in. <br /> <br />
	We are done with class for the day. Have to work on P0 and finish the
	quiz and update learning app. <br /> <br /> tomorrow is jdbc, html,
	css, javascript.





</p>
<h3>Evening:</h3>
<p>I'm back. I wasted some time adding br's to the previous entries.
	not worth the effort. Maybe I can script something through the html?
	Anyways, I'm going to add some of the stuff Mohammad graced us with
	earlier. Going to go side by side from product-app-alstrom and get this
	working. Okay got my register user working. It was a simple mistake. I
	forgot to put login = new Login(userId, username, password); before
	passing the data to sql. My last thought before calling it a night is
	how to increment across all tables when i insert on 1. Like adding a
	login should add the info to employee and make sure customer knows the
	next available as well. Going to figure this out in the morning.</p>

<h2>22/02/22</h2>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
	5:50am- I see more clearly how to study and learn. Starting now. I'll
	go back and add the basics to my app. The core of Java and SQL and all
	other subjects we learn. Prioritize items to memorize based on what
	they are. I've been doing a blind study method that isn't working good
	enough. I added postgres dependency to pom.xml for learning-app and the
	Driver location to app.java. <br /> <br /> We are about to start this
	QC orientation. I don't know why we are doing this instead of studying
	as I feel I understand what QC's are for and how to improve at them,
	but will go in with open mind. It feels like we are already a bit
	behind covering material and yesterday we lost 4.5 hours to QC then we
	did lunch. By the time we came back we had 1.5 hours to learn. Anyways
	that's enough ranting. I'll update as it progresses. This is literally
	the same Orientation that we already sat through.... A little
	frustrating but let me see if there's anything I can learn from
	watching again. Some good tips: Watch how trainer debugs problems that
	happen. Write pseuodcode. Record yourself preparing for QC and watch
	the recording. <br /> <br /> Finished with the 2nd go at QC. It was
	actually nice to rehear some of the points again. I think if my batch
	mates are open to the suggestions they reiterated it would benefit all
	of us. Most of the answers I hear and I give sound like the average or
	poor answers and the goal is to get a job at the end of this. So I have
	a LOT of room to improve and will continue to make the effort to do so.
	<br /> <br /> Now we are in class with Mohammad. We are leaving the
	QC behind us and Mohammad will do 1:1 with each of us to communicate
	feedback. Now we are back into JDBC and preparing for everything we
	need to know for P0. Step 1: Load the appropriate driver Step 2: Create
	the connection url username password //java.sql package Connection con
	=
	DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres",
	"postgres", "admin"); //System.out.println("Connected"); add
	SQLException throws exception PRETTY SWEET WE ARE CONNECTED! Step 3:
	Statement stat = con.createStatement(); Step 4: ResultSet res =
	stat.executeQuery("select * from employees"); // takes the cursor to
	the next row // and returns false if no record is there
	while(res.next()) { System.out.println(res.getString(1)+ " ");
	System.out.println(res.getString(2)+ " ");
	System.out.print(res.getInt("salary")+ " ");
	System.out.println(res.getString("email")); } // closing the resultset,
	statement and connection res.close(); stat.close(); con.close(); //make
	sure you have imports for SQL //Do we have anyway by which we can
	retrieve the column information ResultSetMetaData rsmd =
	res.getMetaData(); int columnCount = rsmd.getColumnCount(); // printing
	the column names for (int i = 1; i<=columnCount; i++){
	System.out.print(rsmd.getColumnName(i)+" "); } System.out.println(); //
	printing all the values of the table for (int i =1; i <= columnCount;
	i++) { System.out.print(res.getString(i) + " "); }
	System.out.println(); ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ that is SWEEEEEEET 22:32p he says
	DEFINITION QC Answer for metadata We are now back from a 23 minute
	break Now we are learning about insert and update as well. Create
	another class called InsertDemo //driver //connection Instead of
	writing the driver and connection in each class we will use a method
	and call the method in .utility package DBConnection public static
	Connection getConnection() { Connection con = null; try{
	Class.forName("org.postgresql.Driver"); con =
	DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres",
	"postgres", "admin"); } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
	e.printStackTrace(); } catch (SQLException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }
	return con; } now we write Connection con =
	DBConnection.getConnection(); I had this thought earlier but it feels
	like Mohammad is giving us superpowers. And it's a really nice feeling.

	use case: how can a customer change password without downloading java?
	we should be able to change the password and other details without
	changing our code. Externalize the properties in a file. properties
	file go to a drive and create notepad file username=postgres
	password=root driver=org.postgresql.Driver
	url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres saves as
	"revaturedb.properties" then we read it from eclipse try { FileReader
	rdr = new FileReader("revaturedb.properties"); Properties properties =
	new Properties(); properties.load(rdr); String driver =
	properties.getProperty("driver"); String url =
	properties.getProperty("url"); String username =
	properties.getProperty("username"); String password =
	properties.getProperty("password"); Class.forName(driver); con =
	DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password); } catch
	(FileNotFoundException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } catch (SQLException)
	{ e.printStackTrace(); } Mohammad just show us how to create a
	properties file so that we can have username, password, driver, and url
	in external file for easy changes. So this is awesome and basically
	answers the question for password security when adding database
	projects to github. to always hide the file that includes passwords or
	sensitive data. I remember googling this while living in Mexico and
	feeling like I was just copying and pastying until I could get
	something to work. It's so nice to be introduced to this from a place
	of understanding. go to product-app-alstrom app run it and try 6. open
	pom.xml and add postgres dependency create package-
	com.training.pms.utility copy DBConnection.java and paste into this
	project's utility package copy revaturedb.properties and paste into
	this project got to DAOImpl and add at top- Connection connection =
	DBConnection.getConnection();


	------------------------------------------------ copy and paste
	Statement and ResultSet stuff Statement stat = null; create case 6:


	Mohammad says we will be ready to go for creating skeleton for P zero,
	but now we have lunch. After an associates problem is resolved.
	Actually we will do after lunch. See you then.


</p>
<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
<p>I'm back and ready to keep learning. in DAOImpl copy and paste
	Statement state and ResultSet and while loop with res.next() into this
	project put entire thing inside one try catch block now you have to
	call the method in ProductApp.java case 6:
	productDAO.printAllProducts(); Now we are able to print all products in
	this previous made product-app-alstrom project. It's very cool how this
	happens and things clicking together for Java and SQL through JDBC and
	postgres. hands on exercise: DBEAVER insert into product values
	(3,'Aroma',199,99); insert into product values (4,'Mouse',12,6); select
	* from product where productName like 'Mouse'; try to search for a
	product by name and return Enter the product name : _____ Here are the
	details for : _____ copy and paste code from printAllProducts to
	searchByProductName change to stat.executeQuery("select * from product
	where productName like '"+productName+"'"); create case 5:
	System.out.println("Please enter product name to search :");
	productName = scanner.next();
	productDAO.searchByProductName(productName);

	-------------------------------------------------------------- now we
	are able to search by name in a database.....sweet. got it working in
	my bank app too. just need to add the bank tables in database enter the
	price (lower) : 3000 enter the price (upper) : 5000 SQL - "select *
	from product where price between" +lower+" and "+ upper prepared
	statements- **** IMPORTANT QC AND INTERVIEW QUESTION @ 2:51am
	difference between Statement and PreparedStatement Interfaces Statement
	interface is used for executing static SQL statements.

	PreparedStatement gives us the flexibility of specifying paramenters
	with the ? symbol. if you have static SQL use statement if you have
	parameters then you use PreparedStatement replace Statement stat with
	PreparedStatement stat stat = connection.prepareStatement("select *
	from product where productName like ? "); stat.setString(l,
	productName); ResultSet res = stat.executeQuery();

	-------------------------------------------------------------- talking
	about the DAO **** DAO - data access objects add to ProductDAO.java
	interface public void searchProductByPrice(int lowerprice, int
	upperprice); copy code from searchProductByName private final SQL_QUERY
	stat = con.prepareStatement("select * from product where price between
	? and ?"); stat.setInt(1,lowerprice); stat.setInt(2,upperprice); add
	case 7: to search by price (lower/upper) case 7:
	System.out.println("Please enter product price (lower) :"); int
	lowerprice = scanner.nextInt(); System.out.println("Please enter
	product price (upper) :"); int upperprice = scanner.nextInt();
	productDAO.searchProductByPrice(lowerprice,upperprice); break;
	------------------------------------------ now for inserting into
	postgres fom maven we already wrote in ProductApp ProductDAOImpl.java
	statement = con.prepareStatement("insert into product
	values(?,?,?,?)"); statement.setInt(1, product.getProductId());
	statement.setString(2, product.getProductName()); statement.setInt(3,
	product.getQuantityOnHand()); statement.setInt(4, product.getPrice());

	int rows = statement.executeUpdate(); System.out.println(rows+"
	inserted successfully") surround in try catch block so dope Mohammad
	just showed us how to insert from Eclipse We are in full connected
	mode!!! Now we are checking update as well. It's already written in
	ProductApp.java Go to Impl copy and paste from add product to update
	product connection.prepareStatement("update product set productName =
	?, quantityonhand = ?, price = ? where productId = ?");

	statement.setString(1, product.getProductName()); statement.setInt(2,
	product.getQuantityOnHand()); statement.setInt(3, product.getPrice());
	statement.setInt(4, product.getProductId()); int rows =
	statement.executeUpdate(); System.out.println(rows+" updated
	successfully") write in postgres first to check you are getting it
	right. copy and paste replace amounts with ?s. done for the day. Very
	happy with what we learned and feel ready to complete huge chunks of P
	zero.</p>
<h3>Evening:</h3>
<p>And here we are in the evening. 4:54pm. Going to make the updates
	to bank app that we learned in our product app during class today and
	create table. I added the table and will see how it connects in the
	morning.</p>

<h2>21/02/22</h2>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
	Starting QC now! Wish me luck. <br /> Think I did well but definitely
	got the answer wrong a bit. My questions were what is Maven? Where does
	Maven get dependencies from? What are scalar and aggregate functions in
	SQL? The correct answer is Scalar functions perform an operation on
	values returned from a query. Such as UCASE(), LCASE(), LENGTH(),
	ROUND(). Aggregate functions calculate on a set of values and return a
	single value. Some examples are: AVG(), COUNT(), MIN(), MAX(), SUM().

	Here are some questions for other people: What is difference between
	WHERE and HAVING? What is POM.xml used for? What are some SQL
	datatypes? Define method overloading and method overriding? What is a
	wrapper class? What is SQL and why is it important for us as
	developers? What is a schema? (name removed) does a good job of
	creating a story when answering. Something to use when knowing the
	answer. What is a transaction? What properties must a transaction
	follow? What are generics? Write an example of generics. Can you tell
	me the difference between a List and a Set? What is a map in Java?
	Difference between ALTER and UPDATE commands? What is a JOIN? <br /> <br />
	THE ART OF THE ANSWER: Answer with correct answer AND give GREAT
	example personal to my RECENT experience. The correct answer alone does
	not prove I know the answer. DONT: Say I think, UMM, I believe, that's
	my best guess, I'm not sure, I don't know. Even if you don't know, no
	one cares. Respond like you know and you have a chance of being right.
	Humility does not matter in an interview they are making an investment
	on you and your ability. <br /> I'm going to do better on the next QC
	or project presentation. I know how to do better. <br /> It's been
	taking a while for this QC. Started at 7am my time and now it's 11:31.
	Not sure if that's a bad sign, but I hope my fellow classmates are safe
	and our teacher too. The topics we've went over take a lot of repition
	and hands on experience. Let's see what happens but the anticipation is
	killing me.

</p>
<h3>Afternoon:</h3>
<p>
	We are going to start the day after QC with a coding challenge. Coding
	challenge was pretty easy. Now we are learning JDBC so we have it for
	building out projects. Java Database Connectivity Connects Java to
	SQL/Database GUI and CUI to DB to have the proper drivers for postgres
	to talk with JAVA you to- Class.forName("org.postgresql.Driver"); throw
	an exception for it Very cool that all we have to do is add the
	dependency code to the pom.xml file and poof. It's connected. Next I
	assume we go to DBeaver and connect from there. This stuff is dope. <a
		href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.postgresql/postgresql/42.3.3">JDBC
		Driver</a> and some documentation fun- <a
		href="https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/80/connect.html">JDBC
		Docs</a> also I am trying to fit in the HTC (how to code) course in the
	free time that doesn't exist. I know it creates good practices. <a
		href="https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:UBCx+HtC1x+2T2017/home">HTC
		Simple Data</a> Overloading is process by which we have same method name
	and different parameters. What is difference between abstract class and
	interface? Maven gets dependencies from. What is driver? What is types
	of driver? Going to take a breather after this class and get back in
	later on to update my learning app. I think I mainly feel there are so
	many individual things to memorize for QCs that I don't get a strong
	handle on what is asked. As Mohammad said.. instead of trying to
	memorize things word for word I'm going to take the most important
	points and know them in and out entirely. The core fundamentals. When
	he brought up the question about differencies between abstract class
	and interface it leaves me somewhat unsure... like I could answer the
	memorized answer when it was asked 3 weeks ago, but now I just know an
	interface allows for multiple inheritance and abstract classes must
	have their methods implemented by child classes.. is that right? After
	looking <a
		href="https://www.javatpoint.com/difference-between-abstract-class-and-interface">here</a>
	I think the correct answer is- Abstract class can have abstract and
	non-abstract methods. Interface can only have abstract methods.
	Interface supports multiple inheritance and abstract classes do not.
	Abstract class can implement an interface but interface cant implement
	an abstract class. Interface can only extend another interface. Maybe I
	do the definition with workable examples as I talked about before. Okay
	that's enough! See you later.

<div id="Diary">
	<span class="name">Diary</span> section.

<!-- POST Diary entries below -->

<h2>20/02/22</h2>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>It's 5:35am on a Sunday and I need to memorize 100 ideas from the
	last week. I need to break it into smaller fun chunks of information.
	My imagination has to take over to make this work. Let's see what I
	have available.</p>
<p>
	I had this idea for a video game style learning adventure. It would
	probably translate well to VR. Immersive walk through experience. Like
	you enter your memory area a place special to you. A place you know.
	And then the game develops ideas based on what you need to learn and in
	the best way for you to learn. Some ideas are people and groups of
	people with personalities, some ideas are buildings or homes, some are
	objects, some are billboards, some are a videogame within a videogame,
	it's endless. Where is your infinite well of knowledge and how can it
	be made visual? I'm a visual learner so it's a necessity for me. Track
	where it is in your brain based on your interactions. Instead of
	feeling like you are being quizzed it's like walking up to someone and
	trying to remember their name. A different type of pressure. Can I
	start now? How best to do so? Just to start I suppose. It starts in
	eclipse. I've built out the learning project similar to our banking app
	example. I want it to feel and work great, but I don't know how to
	think about doing it. And I worry that just by starting I'm going to
	make mistakes that would save me headaches in the future. I think at
	this stage of my learning this is inevitable and I just have to
	continue. So anyways I've made a App class that creats a LearnApp
	object to call the startLearnApp method. This keeps App.java as basic
	as possible and opens from my custom class of LearnApp.java. I then
	created a Learn.java class that I will use as my model. <br />
	Honestly doing this is freightening. <br /> The amount of mistakes I
	can make is infinite, but this is better than index cards in my mind.
	So it's worth testing. Looking at the BankDAO.java class I can add
	methods to this app in a LearnDAO.java for: public void
	addMemoryItem(Learn item); public void updateMemoryItem(Learn item);
	public void deleteMemoryItem(int memoryId); public void
	searchByMemoryId(int memoryId); public void searchByMemoryName(String
	memoryName); public void printAllMemoryItems(); <br /> but I'm going
	to save this for later. I just want to fill this with information that
	I need now. I ended up just building out LearnDAO.java and
	LearnDAOImpl.java because it was too easy not to. Now I am faced with
	buildng a new object for each memory area or doing it all in
	LearnApp.java... My gut tells me to do a new class for each area. Let
	me try that and see how it goes. <br /> I'm back at the desk after
	family woke up. Debating on attending an OSSU cohort that meets in 4
	minutes. I dont want to take on anything that distracts me, but maybe
	it could be fresh? Idk. Couldnt hurt to try 1 and see how it goes. I've
	tried before in the past but didn't feel it pulling me along like I
	needed. <br /> Just went on a long Maven run with creating a
	learning-app project and injesting all the data into it. I now have a
	project I can build dynamically week after week. I kind of suprised
	myself a bit with this one and am happy with the outcome. I can add it
	to github so I can study from my other computer as well.

<h2>18/02/22</h2>
<h3>Morning:</h3>
<p>
	Downloaded atom on this windows so I can diary my thoughts a bit
	better. I've been trying to keep notes but theyve been a bit bare.
	Let's see if this helps. Most of what we are learning right now is to
	build our bank app. Which is project 0 in this training course. We are
	using SQL Shell for postgresql alongside with DBeaver to show how
	running multiple threads can cause a lock up. We just looked at
	savepoints between updates and inserts so that we can rollback to
	specific points. This is new for me. <br /> <br /> To study: 4 levels
	of isolation we can select for RDBMS- <br /> Serializable <br />
	Repeatable Reads <br /> Read Committed <br /> Read Uncommitted <br />
	<br /> Now we are done talking about transactions. On to DDL:
	Truncate, create, alter, drop. Now we are learning about creating a
	table and inserting items. It's cool because we are able to check in
	the SQL Shell as we do so. We just used primary key, unique, and check
	to create constraints for the items we are adding to table. The DBeaver
	was doing some weird things when trying to create and drop tables with
	the Auto-Commit disabled for Manual Committ (Read Committed). This is
	something to be aware of when building out tables for Bank project. On
	to our first 20 minute break. Good day so far. Having music on in the
	background makes a huge difference for me. I've disabled spell check
	and trying to remove the autocomplete without making it a hassle to
	write inside here. Back to listening to Mohammad. Now we are learning
	about auto incrementing for primary key into table. Using serial,
	sequence. Sequence is nice because you can modify the start and
	increment amount. <br /> Feeling pretty good about this table stuff.
	I'm having some fun with it by using my Philadelphia friend's names. I
	need to do that more often to get comfortable. Now we are on to
	Normalization- Helps us to break the table into different parts We are
	moving to foreign keys because he cant find document pertaining to
	normalization. When the primary key of one table is available in
	another as a non primary key column-> foreign key. Foreign key is very
	easy to understand. Sort of like a door from one table to another. I
	feel like we get way too much time to do the examples. We could do
	twice as many. Why not give us the proposed example as well as an
	advanced example for those of us moving a bit faster? I find myself
	either trying to find examples online or my mind wandering a bit at
	leaset 25% of the class. on delete cascade is used for a child table to
	delete all referenced instances when using delete from students where
	studentId = 211; ^my specific example. Next QC is on Monday from 10am -
	12pm EST. Week 2: Maven Git Wrapper Classes Abstract Interfaces
	StringBuilder String Buffer Overloading CollectionAPI Unit Testing
	JUnit Week 3: Postgres 2/16 all but normalization 2/17 no JDBC nothing
	on 2/18 referential integrity constraints data types TCL <br />
	Mohammad updated the curriculum found here: <a
		href="https://app.revature.com/curriculum/12767/batch/1211/viewCalendar">HERE</a>
	<br /> After break we will cover rest of topics and prepare for QC.
	SQL Quiz questions QC questions Mohammad will share with us. <br /> <br />
	Possible QC QuestionS: What is referential integrity? <br /> <br />
	ALTER TABLE statements to add, drop, Alter makes changes to table
	structure Update makes changes to values/data On to Set Operators Union

	Union All Intersect returns the same items from each table Except/Minus
	returns distinct rows selected by 1st query not present in 2nd query.

	Have all the QC resources from Mohammad saved to ->
	C:\Users\Winterfam\Desktop\Revature\QC_PREPARE\QC_Week2_Week3 Im using
	GIT on here to push to my github repo. I like the public nature of what
	I am doing being open to anyone, anytime. Back from another 20 minute
	break that I spent at my computer. <br /> Back to normalization- to
	reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. and we are done for
	the day. I'll be back to prepare notes / index cards for the QC
